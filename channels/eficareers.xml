            <description><![CDATA[If you thought hedge funds were cute places paying tens of millions </news/hedge-fund-bonus> while everyone pats one another on the back, we regret to inform you that this is not always so. And if you still need persuading, we would like to refer you to the recent court filings of Citadel <https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r9kbLhLe1TBU/v0>  <https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rudxzR._AYfI/v0>and Marshall Wace <https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rudxzR._AYfI/v0>.

The two funds are locked in a battle over Marshall Wace's recruitment of Citadel's Daniel Shatz </news/2023/06/dan-shatz-citadel-marshall-wace>, whom Marshall Wace says was a "top credit portfolio manager" at its rival. Shatz left Citadel in 2023. He joined Marshall Wace 15 months later after a period of gardening leave, and he is now Marshall Wace's global head of credit. The situation between his current and former employers has been fraught ever since.

For its part, Marshall Wace seems to hold a very great dislike for Citadel.  In its court filing, Marshall Wace describes Ken Griffin's firm as a "behemoth" that it says is "well known for its aggressive tactics" when recruiting. Marshall Wace claims that Citadel "has been accused of engaging in bullying and intimidation" [it does not say by whom] when it "does not get its own way" while hiring. Marshall Wace also says that Citadel is only "lashing out" because one of its employees chose to join a competitor and scornfully suggests that: "Apparently, Citadel, lulled into competitive complacency and believing that they can simply buy talent by writing the biggest check, does not react well when forced to engage in healthy competition." 

Citadel seems less vituperative. However, it still accuses Shatz of “shamelessly violating” its employment agreements. And Citadel feels wronged after paying "tens of millions" to Shatz, only for him to allegedly misappropriate Citadel’s highly confidential and proprietary information under false pretenses," and then (allegedly) hire his Citadel friend Joshua Lercher in violation of his contract.

Shatz and Marshall Wace deny all of this. Shatz says Citadel owes him "significant eight figure deferred compensation" and claims to have been "retaliated against by Citadel for complaining about potential securities violations." Citadel says it doesn't owe Shatz this deferred compensation because of his unlawful conduct. 

Citadel now wants to see the messages between Shatz and Lercher to unearth the truth of the matter. It also wants information from Nicholas Nielsen, Marshall Wace's quant trading head who worked for Citadel in the past, and who it says recruited Shatz. But Marshall Wace says it's already provided 2,400 pages of documents in response to a former Citadel request and that it would be both "unduly burdensome" and a breach of privacy to ask Shatz and Lercher to dredge up personal messages from the past. Marshall Wace says Nielsen has nothing to do with Citadel, other than working there 15 years ago. And so it goes on. 

Underpinning the entire dispute is the vicious competition for top hedge fund talent. On one hand, Citadel insists Shatz stole its "confidential and proprietary hiring and recruiting information," including its recruiting lists, scorecards for evaluating candidates and confidential roadmaps for building a credit business. On the other, Marshall Wace says it can't possibly share critical messages between Shatz and Lercher with Citadel because doing so would give away its very own "sensitive personnel information" and might then enable Citadel to hire Lercher back again or maybe even "unfairly gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace for talent." Citadel says it has no interest in or need for this kind of information from Marshall Wace and that it simply wants materials showing whether Shatz breached his employment contract.

Either way, Marshall Wace doesn't appear to have any regrets about its self-described ability to "lure Shatz away from Citadel." And even though Citadel claims that Shatz "mislead Marshall Wace about his experience and qualifications," Marshall Wace seems to like him. Marshall Wace says that if Shatz and Lercher were simultaneously absent from its credit desk while testifying to the arbitration panel, it would cause all sorts of problems and require "advanced planning" to avoid trouble. Citadel might argue this is just an excuse.

The case is both complicated and unpleasant. But maybe this is what happens when, as Marshall Wace, says two funds "recruit from the same small pool of highly accomplished financial professionals in the New York City market."

            <description><![CDATA[It's bonus  </news/everything-we-know-about-2026-bonuses-by-bank>season in banks, but this is not all. It's also bonus season in hedge funds </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job>. And while hedge fund bonuses  </news/pay-hedge-funds>used to be a simple issue, things have become a lot more complicated.

If you work as a portfolio manager in a hedge fund you are typically paid a proportion of the profits you generate for investors. That proportion was traditionally around 20% of profits, but citing a report from Goldman Sachs </news/how-to-get-a-job-goldman-sachs>, the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/e8392857-7a97-4b0c-9098-ca498ddcbee7> reported last year that it had risen to 24.5% for the best portfolio managers at top multistrategy hedge funds  </news/big-multistrategy-hedge-funds>like Citadel, </news/2022/10/how-to-get-a-job-at-citadel> Millennium  </news/2021/02/how-to-get-a-job-at-hedge-fund-millennium>and Balyasny.  </news/2023/10/balyasny-hedge-fund>

Hedge funds are incredibly secretive about their bonuses but industry insiders say most of the big multistrategy funds have announced bonuses already. Dymon Asia </news/dymon-asia-hiring> announced earlier this week. Qube  </news/qrt-hedge-fund>Research and Technologies announced Tuesday. Resulting bonuses are typically paid before the end of this month, although some may drag into March.

Hedge fund bonuses are about more than the profit cut, though. Below portfolio manager  </news/2023/09/portfolio-manager-job-hedge-fund>(PM) level things are often more blurred. Juniors aren't on profit formulas. Analysts are often paid based on a more discretionary appraisal of their input from PMs (prompting complaints) </news/analyst-hedge-fund> and middle and back office staff get what remains.

Historically, hedge fund bonuses were paid in all cash. This is changing. While Balyasny Asset Management (BAM) still pays entirely in cash, other funds will sometimes defer. 

At Citadel, for example, employees must invest half their bonuses </news/the-other-hedge-fund-pay-perk-reinvesting-in-the-funds> above an undisclosed threshold into Citadel's Wellington Fund for three and a half years. At Qube, bonuses are discretionary and up to 75% are reinvested in Qube's funds </news/qube-qrt-pay> for a three year period. At Point72, some employees have 25% or less of their bonuses on a three year vesting period. At BlueCrest </news/working-for-bluecrest> (technically Mike Platt's </news/what-s-it-like-to-work-for-mike-platt-at-blue-crest-capital-management> family office </news/family-office-jobs>), multiple sources say that three year deferrals are the norm. At Millennium, we understand that all-cash bonuses are the norm, but that some people may be on deferrals.   

If you're a particularly desirable portfolio manager, your bonus may also include an "accelerator" in which you receive a higher proportion of your initial profits, as long as they are also generated within the bounds of a particular sharpe ratio.   

Deferrals can be popular when investing into a firm's funds gives employees access to returns. However, the preferred hedge funds are often paying all-cash in the style of Balyasny Asset Management. "This is the selling point," says one portfolio manager. It's unfortunate, then, that deferrals and clawbacks are becoming more common.

            <title>Do you still need to be a junior banker to get hired by Blackstone?</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> has long been the career dream for many aspiring finance professionals, even in a tough market </news/private-equity-work-hours>, but getting into a top firm </news/best-place-to-work-private-equity> isn't easy. Historically, to work in private equity for a firm like Blackstone </news/what-its-like-to-work-at-blackstone>, many people got a job at one of the major investment banks </news/what-is-an-investment-bank>, then accepted a deferred offer to join Blackstone in their first year. Today, paths into private equity aren't as one-dimensional.

Follow eFinancialCareers on Google News here. <https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV1ZtYVc1aGJtTnBZV3hqWVhKbFpYSnpMbU52YlNnQVAB?ceid=GB:en&oc=3> 

Speaking this week's LSE's Alternative Investments Conference, Saleh Panahi, a senior MD at Blackstone, said times have changed. Although banking "is probably still the most common route into private equity, it now sits alongside a wider range of entry paths." 

Panahi himself started out in banking himself with boutique </news/boutique-investment-banks> firm Lazard </news/lazard-q4-2025> and "didn't know what private equity was" when he first joined the bank. He was convinced to join PE when he "noticed some of my more senior colleagues moving into it."

That was back in 2012. Since then, Blackstone has massively ramped up its internship </news/internship-investment-bank> and graduate </news/finance-grad-job-uk> program. Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/blackstone-summer-analysts-associates-interns-steve-schwarzman-advice-2025-6#:~:text=The%20firm%20now%20recruits%20from,just%20for%20landing%20the%20internship.> reported last June that the firm hired over 170 interns in 2025. Blackstone has been hiring students from universities for over 30 years and used to be very selective. In 2015, Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/blackstone-summer-analysts-associates-interns-steve-schwarzman-advice-2025-6#:~:text=The%20firm%20now%20recruits%20from,just%20for%20landing%20the%20internship.> said it was hiring from nine schools. In the past 10 years, Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/blackstone-summer-analysts-associates-interns-steve-schwarzman-advice-2025-6#:~:text=The%20firm%20now%20recruits%20from,just%20for%20landing%20the%20internship.> said it reportedly hired from 1,000. 

The only problem with this route is that Blackstone's acceptance rate is incredibly low and getting lower; Business Insider  <https://www.businessinsider.com/blackstone-analyst-class-entry-level-recruiting-2025-11>reported it accepted 0.4% of applicants in 2021 and 0.2% of applicants in 2025.

Blackstone has also ramped up its hiring into non-investment roles which don't need bankers. As Blackstone grows, Panahi said the firm needs "more specialised expertise, and that widens the funnel for the types of CVs that make it into private equity." For example, he said that teams of quants  </news/quant-jobs-finance>analyzing Blackstone's portfolio companies have "really taken off for us over the last ten years... really helping the top of house spot megatrends before it turns into publicly available data." Blackstone's data scientists sit within its operating team led by Rodney Zemmel, a PhD biologist who spent just shy of three decades at consulting firm McKinsey before joining Blackstone last march. 

The firm's data science  </news/the-highest-paying-data-science-jobs-in-finance>team is led by an ex-Credit Suisse M&A banker, Matt Katz, but you don't need banking experience to join the data team. Recent hires include Tim Bush, a PhD </news/do-you-need-a-phd-for-a-quant-job-in-finance> physicist who joined as an MD from DefenceTech firm Palantir. </news/palantir-engineering-culture-2am> Recent associate-level hires have previously worked at hardware startup Arena and Starbucks (as a data scientist, not a barista). Working as a quant or data scientist in a bank is also a route in. The issue with joining in these kinds of non-investment roles is that you're less likely to get paid carried interest </news/what-is-carried-interest>, the key appeal of working in PE for many people. 

Blackstone has been diversifying its talent pool, while investment banks have been looking to cut off the supply of banking analyst talent. JPMorgan told juniors last year </news/accepting-investment-bank-offer-internship> that it would fire anyone that it found taking a future-dated offer, and Goldman Sachs made its analyst swear </news/goldman-sachs-oath> they had not taken a private equity offer on a regular basis shortly after. This seemingly put a kibosh on PE hiring last year, but many big firms simply pushed their recruitment drive to this January.

The French bank isn't commenting but Latreche appears to have left the French bank after joining from BNP Paribas in June 2025. Latreche himself didn't respond to a request to comment for this article, but his Linkedn profile says he's "seeking new challenges." 

Latreche's registration <https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/rr> with the Singapore Monetary Authority suggests he may not have officially joined SocGen. He was last registered as working for BNP Paribas from 2018 to 2024. Latreche spent nearly 24 years at BNP in total after working his way out of the bank's operations team. </news/operations-jobs-banking>

It's not clear what Latreche plans to do next but during an 11 month career break before joining SocGen, he was an advisor to a skincare website <https://sachiskin.com/pages/about> founded by a former BNP FX trader. There, Latreche says he learned about AI, e-commerce and skincare, so the possibilities are manifold.

Speaking at this week's UBS Financial Services Conference, JPMorgan's co-CEO of the commercial and investment bank, Troy Rohrbaugh </news/jp-morgan-s-investment-bank-co-heads-have-wildly-different-amounts-of-stock>, said the bank hired 1,000 people in the front office </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking> last year and that around 333 of those were "senior bankers." This year, co-head of global banking Filippo Gori, has said that JPMorgan wants yet more bankers <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/jpmorgan-is-hiring-across-europe-with-investor-confidence-rising> in Europe, where it intends to be, "hiring in every country, pretty much across the region."

If JPMorgan isn't your cup of tea, there are alternatives. Financial News  <https://www.fnlondon.com/amp/articles/european-bank-execs-point-to-dealmaking-growth-after-lacklustre-fees-51e35794>points out that UBS wants another 25 managing directors, to add to the 25 managing directors it hired last year, with a focus on the US market. Deutsche Bank is hiring another 60 bankers, too, and is also thinking of the US. Wells Fargo has it in mind  </news/wells-fargo-md-hiring>to hire another 25-30 senior bankers. Only Barclays seems hesitant, saying it's made the "investments" and "got the talent" and now expects the revenues to flow.

With luck, they will flow bounteously. CEOs speaking at this week's conference were unspeakably optimistic about the possibilities for this year. "I think it can be really possibly one of the better years we've seen in a very long time in M&A or certainly in that top decile," declared Rohrbaugh. "In terms of the M&A market, I think this could be a top decile, top quartile, certainly, potentially top decile kind of M&A opportunity set," pondered David Solomon at Goldman Sachs. 

The subtext to this enthusiasm is that private equity firms are getting desperate. They need to sell existing investments and they can't stop waiting for a good price. "They've got to return capital, whether they're selling stuff and they're going to the M&A market or they're getting stuff public, they've got to return more capital," also said Solomon. Private equity firms really need some "liquidity events" in 2025, agreed Rohrbaugh. At the same time, Rohrbaugh said "trade corridors" are shifting to, "Middle East to Asia, Middle East to Europe, Middle East to Latin America. Asia to Europe," and that this too is creating opportunities. 

Hiring senior bankers is usually followed by hiring junior bankers. Experienced vice presidents are in vogue </news/vp-pay-banking>, but associates </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds> may follow. The only danger is the kind of black swan event that has become a white swan in recent years. Rohrbaugh observed that he was equally optimistic at the start of 2025: "And then April 2 happened."

Separately, if you're struggling to pay the bills each month, spare a thought for Leon Black, the former CEO of Apollo Global Management, whose personal run rate is out of control.

The Wall Street Journal  <https://www.wsj.com/finance/inside-a-5-billion-fortune-one-familys-ledger-in-the-epstein-files-23455b75?mod=e2tw>observes that the Black family are big spenders. Documents released in the Epstein files suggest they spend $600k a month. In a two month period in 2015, they spent twice that, including $27k on dining out, $35k on clothing, $67k on alcohol and $48k for landscaping at their home in the Hamptons. Eleven years ago, they also had a $484m loan to repay.

Leon Black is no longer at Apollo, but he is not buying £10 wine. Black still owns 7% of Apollo and is worth an estimated $14bn. At the time of the information in the Epstein files he owned seven homes, 11 cars, a Gulfstream jet and a Benetti yacht.

Meanwhile...

Wells Fargo has been hiring senior bankers and says: "We've hired roughly 100 or so senior folks across the investment bank." (Business Insider)  <https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-hiring-spree-investment-bankers-2026-2>

            <description><![CDATA[You don't have to work for the US or British central banks to present your opinions on monetary policy. Nor do you need an internship </news/hedge-funds-with-graduate-training-programmes> with US hedge fund Citadel to impress the head of its fixed income business. If you're a current university student, both things can be achieved simply by entering a single competition.

Following last year's inaugural 'Fixed income and macro Central Bank challenge', </news/citadel-wants-us-students-with-ideas-for-the-federal-reserve> which was open only to students in the US and Canada, Citadel is back with two similarly named challenges open to first and second year students in the US, Canada and Europe.  

Winners of the challenges receive cash prizes. They will also get to interact with Edwin Lin, Citadel's head of fixed income and macro. Lin returned from his brief sabbatical last year. He will be an active participant in the competition, as will Angel Ubide, Citadel's head of economic research for his business area.

Select competition entrants will work in small teams to develop monetary recommendations, before defending their thinking and presenting to a panel. Last year's winning team included Esther Yu, a physics and maths student at the University of North Carolina who coincidentally also won a previous women's datathon organised by Citadel.

Writing on LinkedIn, Yu says her team used "VAR models, a DSGE [Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium] simulation, and a modified Taylor Rule to weigh inflation risks against complex supply-side shocks and evolving labor market dynamics." Another member of Yu's team is an intern on Citadel's fixed income and macro team this summer.

Entrants have until February 27th to enter the US competition and until March 6th to enter in the UK. Last year, Yu says over 1,500 people entered in the US; 40 were selected to participate. Citadel says it's keen to hear from people studying mathematics, economics, statistics, computer science, or other STEM related fields.

Would-be entrants might want to familiarize themselves with the opinions of Ubide. Last September, Ubide declared  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/citadel-s-ubide-says-us-economy-is-in-a-fragile-equlibrium>that the US economy is in a fragile equilibrium and "close to the edge," with Treasury yields the key long term indicator of the proximity of the chasm. 

"Any rapid move above 5% [in long term Treasury yields] could be scary for risk assets,” added Ubide. That rate is currently 4.8%. If you're pitching monetary policy ideas, you might want to keep this in mind.

            <description><![CDATA[US banks may have announced their bonuses already </news/everything-we-know-about-2026-bonuses-by-bank>, but if you work for HSBC the moment of truth has not arrived. When it comes on February 25th, it could be harsh.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/hsbc-to-cull-underperformers-as-some-bankers-face-zero-bonuses> reported last week that HSBC is both changing its basis for allocating bonuses and intending to pay some of its people no bonuses </news/banker-bonuses> at all. From now on, variable compensation at the bank will be based on an eat what you kill calculation. Kill nothing; you will earn nothing.

This sounds fair, but as we noted last week </news/hsbc-s-zero-bonuses-risk-upsetting-already-traumatised-bankers> it's not that simple. In investment banking </news/what-is-an-investment-bank> in particular, responsibility for originating deals can be unclear. HSBC has a complex origination structure involving sector specialists, product specialists and investment and corporate bankers. All will want their share.

"Many people are worried that compensation this year will not be allocated on a meritocratic basis," says one HSBC managing director  </news/md-pay-investment-banks>(MD). "It's not eat what you kill here. It's eat if you're friends with the right senior people."

A spokesperson for HSBC said: “We are committed to attracting and retaining talent as part of a high-performance culture, ensuring our employees are rewarded competitively.” 

Some insiders insist their apprehension is nonetheless valid. Veterans at the bank object to the ex-Citi people </news/hsbc-is-increasingly-run-by-people-who-ve-joined-from-citi> who occupy senior positions. "It's become my way or the highway," says one. Insiders point to 25+ exits from the US debt capital markets business in particular in the past few years, with some people leaving of their own volition for lesser platforms or without jobs to go to. 

Unfair bonuses in the past may have triggered those exits. "There's a difference between where revenues are booked and where they're originated," claims one HSBC banker.  "Some people have received preferential treatment," says another, who quit.

HSBC has hired alongside its exits. The bank added Jake Hartman from Barclays last August as head of FIG DCM; Margaret Szczerbicki joined on the US syndicate desk in December.

For all the complaints, it's also possible that bonuses at HSBC really needed to change.

In last year's bonus round, the bank paid its 135 material risk takers (typically MDs and other senior staff) an average of $1.4m each </news/hsbc-cuts-pay-for-top-bankers-and-traders-to-1-4m-amidst-ominous-bonus-rumours> in combined salary and bonus. Some of its MDs may not have been deserving of this. 

HSBC announced the closure its M&A and ECM </news/hscb-closure-europe-us-job-cuts> businesses outside of Asia and the Middle East in January 2025. One senior executive subsequently told the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/61e8d4e1-e49b-4048-9998-d33ac5f87d8e> that people had been paid despite originating no deals. If they're still there this year, they will be paid commensurate with that.

            <description><![CDATA[Multiple electronic trading </news/high-frequency-trading-hiring-and-pay> firms have built up sizeable teams in Australia, </news/as-jane-street-and-other-prop-trading-firms-expand-in-asia-these-are-the-new-faces-and-new-teams#:~:text=Australia%3A%20Optiver%20and,IMC%20and%20Optiver.> but Hudson River Trading (HRT)  </news/working-for-hudson-river-trading>is a notable exception. Despite this, it seems to appreciate talent in the region; it just hired a senior trader from Citadel Securities </news/2022/10/how-to-get-a-job-at-citadel> and relocated him to New York.

David Zderic joined HRT as an algorithm developer. He spent two years at market maker Citadel Securities, where he was latterly the firm's head of APAC low latency trading based in the firm's Sydney office, home to ~90 employees. He left the firm in May 2024, 21 months ago, which would suggest that he has been on an extended gardening leave period. 

Zderic also spent eight years with another market maker, IMC. </news/a-high-frequency-trading-firm-is-offering-its-interns-425k-to-come-back-as-open-ai-looms> He joined as a systems engineer initially before transitioning into a trading role. He also spent the last two years at the firm based in Chicago before moving back to Sydney with Citadel Securities. 

Hudson River Trading has distanced itself from the notion that it's a pure high-frequency trading firm. Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast, the firm's head of AI Iain Dunning said that medium frequency strategies (held for minutes to days at a time) ar now "a big part of the business." It still has some high performing HFT teams, however; Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-19/jane-street-india-unit-saw-trading-gains-soar-494-before-curbs> reported that the firm's team in India made $264m in profits last year, compared to $248m at Citadel Securities and $334m at Jane Street. 

Hudson River Trading's algorithm developers are led by Jesse Cohen </news/jesse-cohen-hrt>, an ex-Goldman Sachs MD who joined the firm aged 28. He is thought to be a big star at the firm, and was promoted into the role following the departure of HRT partner Oaz Nir.  </news/oaz-nir>

Anthropic’s AI safety researcher quit two days ago, warning of a world in peril <https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2026/02/09/anthropic-ai-safety-researcher-warns-of-world-in-peril-in-resignation/>, and musing his pursuit of a poetry degree. For some people, however, AI is just a way to make a buck or two.

Enter Barclays’ recently launched AI chatbot, the awkwardly named BARXBot (come on - BarclAI was right there). “This tool delivers FX quotes 75% faster than the previous approach,” Barclays CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan told analysts in the firm’s Q4 earning call yesterday.

That might be worrying. Electronification has been a big worry for traders for years – and salespeople thought they were much safer. If their work can be done 75% faster now, then they’re more at peril than they would like to admit. Back in 2024, Barclays itself said </news/fixed-income-trading-credit-electronification> that “The hybrid nature of some asset classes… Makes them structurally more challenging to trade on a platform.” That might not be the case in the future.

BARXBot is just one part of Barclays’ suite of AI tools. Venkatakrishnan noted that the bank had more than 250 of them in total, which is on par </news/macquarie-q3> with Bank of America’s suite of 270, and well behind both UBS’s and JPMorgan’s offerings. UBS alone has over 340 AI tools in active use.

Venkatakrishnan also said that the firm is “one of the largest users of Microsoft Copilot in the financial services industry,” whose adoption had saved over a million man-hours of work.

The team's London-based co-head Tyrone Lobban tragically died  </news/jpmorgan-crypto-kinexys-onyx-tyrone-lobban>in January. A new co-head was appointed, but other senior people have since left.  </news/a-jp-morgan-product-head-in-london-left-to-build-a-startup-with-a-crypto-market-making-md>Now, at the start of 2026, Kinexys' other initial co-head is departing too.

Singapore </news/singapore-bankers-work-harder-than-hong-kong-colleagues-for-less>-based Naveen Mallela announced his departure from JPMorgan earlier today, after 11 years at the bank. He held a number of roles before joining Kinexys, including the head of innovation for global technology in JPMorgan's Singapore tech hub. Mallela has held a leadership role at Kinexys since 2020, and was promoted to MD in 2022 while in the role. A JPMorgan spokesperson said that the bank wishes him well in his future endeavours and plans to name a replacement soon.

Kinexys' remaining co-head is Kara Kennedy, an executive director based in Edinburgh that has spent four and a half years at the bank. She previously spent eight years at BNY Mellon in London, latterly working on blockchain technology. Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-06/jpmorgan-names-new-global-co-head-of-blockchain-division> reported that she was appointed in August to run its tokenization projects and blockchain research division; Mallela ran the payments division, including its 'information exchange network' Liink. 

Kinexys is still hiring despite the leadership turbulence. The bank has 11 openings in Kinexys across London, Singapore and the US. In Jersey City, it's hiring a principal program manager on a salary of up to $265k.

            <title>Morning Coffee: Morgan Stanley bankers’ post-bonus shock.  The nice guy banker who irritated his colleagues</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/morgan-stanley-bonus-share-price</link>
            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/Dwje42HQRenOjYpUl37z" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[It’s never a nice time to get bad news.  But if you’re in the bonus pool of a major investment bank, some times are distinctly better than others.                  Specifically, if something is going to happen to your employer’s share price, it is best for it to happen in January, after the equity-linked compensation is decided but before it’s converted into a specific number of shares ( this usually occurs either on the announcement date or the day on which cash bonuses are paid).

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Morgan Stanley bankers, therefore, are likely to be cursing their luck <https://www.ft.com/content/1c63983f-5ff0-4b70-ad55-7e4334f59422>.  Their bonuses were announced in January and would typically have been paid last week.  That would have given them a few scant days to enjoy feeling wealthy, before the bank's share price fell yesterday.

It could have been worse. The Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/1c63983f-5ff0-4b70-ad55-7e4334f59422> notes that Morgan Stanley shares were down 2.4%, while Raymond James' shares were down over 8%. The decline was part of a sell-off in wealth management stocks. This appears to have been driven by the effect of a fintech company announcing the launch of an AI-based financial planning tool that appears to replicate a lot of the services provided by wealth managers and by ETrade (owned by Morgan Stanley).

Of course, the best advice that anyone – even an LLM based robo-advisor – will give you is not to look at the value of your equities on a daily basis, as the short term volatility will at best cause needless stress and at worst push you into making bad decisions.  It’s true that $100,000 of Morgan Stanley stock a week ago is worth $96,000 now. But $100,000 of Morgan Stanley stock from a year ago is now worth $130k, and long term equity grants from five years ago have more than doubled during their vesting period. 

And the actual outlook for Morgan Stanley is not bad at all.  Early indications suggest that revenue momentum is still strong, the financial sponsors <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-financial-sponsors-may-boost-dealmaking-activity-2026-02-10/> may be coming back and Michael Grimes </news/michael-grimes-morgan-stanley> has returned from public service to start pitching for some massive IPOs.  Even the competition from AI is not as big a deal for the bank's wealth management arm as it is for Schwab or Raymond James; Morgan Stanley has always been positioned at the higher end of the wirehouse brokerage market, where there is a little more bespoke advice, a bit more personal service and quite a bit more for clients to lose if they accidentally do something dumb because of a chatbot hallucination.

Nevertheless, this is probably the shape of things to come.  As well as eating into financial jobs, AI is likely to start commodifying formerly lucrative services, with consequent effect on share prices. Perhaps it’s not only Morgan Stanley bankers who ought to be looking at this week’s news with a bit of trepidation.

Elsewhere, “doing a good job” and “being a nice guy who everyone likes” are usually the sort of characteristics you want to see in a colleague.  Unless, of course, that colleague is one step above you on the promotion ladder.  Then, it can get irritating.

Standard Chartered's disappearing CFO Diego De Georgi was seemingly frustrated <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/shock-at-standard-chartered-after-ceo-hopeful-de-giorgi-exits> into leaving by the perennially popular and well regarded Bill Winters </news/jes-staley-bill-winters-jpmorgan> at Standard Chartered, whose avuncular charm, steadfast avoidance of scandal and ability to weather difficult conditions in Asian markets had already caused Simon Cooper to lose hope in 2024.  Winters reportedly told the bank's board that he “intends to stay on for longer than previously expected”, and their favourable response to this news seems to have persuaded De Georgi that if he wasn’t going to get the top job, he might as well play second fiddle in the considerably more lucrative orchestra at Apollo.

It’s in many ways a nice problem for the Standard Chartered board to have, but it will become a problem over time.  The bank's share price fell 5% on the announcement of De Georgi’s departure.  That might be because analysts tend to assume that CFOs don’t leave two weeks before a set of results if they’re going to be good news, but it’s also going to reflect the fact that the bank now has a succession management problem.  It’s hard to recruit top talent into a job where the promotion path is closed off, and Winters has yet to master the Jamie Dimon trick of keeping people hanging around for “five more years”.

Meanwhile …

After several years and a compliance near-miss in 2021, McKinsey has finally decided that running a $20billion private hedge fund for its partners doesn’t have quite as many synergies with management consulting as it had hoped. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/mckinsey-hands-over-its-20-billion-investment-arm-to-neuberger>)

Investors are beginning to get suspicious of tech valuations, and more interested in looking at “AI-immune” sectors.  Which means that the food, utilities and mining analysts are finally beginning to get a bit of airtime with clients. (FT <https://www.ft.com/content/577b97f6-2416-48b9-9bd3-717bb202ca71>)

“In the context of the profound and demanding transformation of our company, we are paying particular attention to this”.  Slavomir Krupa at SocGen is dealing with an employee survey which appears to suggest that the transformation program is weighing heavy on employees; optimism, trust in top management and pride in working there are all down. (Bloomberg <https://In%20the%20context%20of%20the%20profound%20and%20demanding%20transformation%20of%20our%20company,%20we%20are%20paying%20particular%20attention%20to%20this>)

The literal meaning of “nepo” is “nephew”, but Aaron Weitman of CastleKnight Management appears to be doing pretty well independently of his famous uncle, David Tepper. (Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/david-teppers-nephew-has-a-hedge-fund-heres-how-its-doing-3b722af1>)

Although Ken Griffin complained last week that CEOs were finding it tedious to spend their time sucking up to successive administrations, Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon is built different, and can always spare some time in an interview to talk about how great the President’s pro-growth policies are going to be. (FT <https://www.ft.com/content/f443b4a1-2efd-4481-82b3-5467cf5f81e5>)

Rajeev Misra used to be famous for taking meetings barefoot, and for making huge bets at the SoftBank Vision Fund, some of which worked well and some less so.  He’s always been at the cutting edge of new trends, though, so it is interesting to see that he’s pivoting his own investment vehicle away from private credit and towards investments in natural resources. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/rajeev-misra-ramps-up-private-equity-bets-as-softbank-scars-fade>)

Traditional futures trading desks have tended to enforce quite strict separation between the activities of “market making” and “trading like a complete chump”.  But prediction markets, at least while the SuperBowl is being played, let you combine the two. (WSJ <https://www.wsj.com/business/media/super-bowl-prediction-betting-1302feda>)

            <description><![CDATA[Today was Macquarie’s Q3 results day, for the period from October to December 2025 (basically, everyone else’s Q4). While the commodities and global markets (CGM) group posted revenue that was “substantially up” on last year, there was something more worrying nestled in the accounts.

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community.  <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/login?_gl=1*ut8n6u*_gcl_au*MTg4MDY2NTExNi4xNzYxNTU3NDIz*_ga*ODczNzI2NTA0LjE3NTM2OTk2ODI.*_ga_NZFQV4MXPM*czE3NjM2NDM0MDYkbzI1NiRnMSR0MTc2MzY0MzQzOSRqMjckbDAkaDMyMjc4OTUzMw..>✍️

The Australian bank noted that its higher revenue was “partially offset by higher operating expenses” driven by investments in the CGM platform. What were those investments exactly? Presumably nothing related to AI. The firm noted that it had just 20 or so active AI use cases implemented within CGM, and another 30 in the pipeline.

That is not a lot. During a call with analysts in Q3 last year, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that the bank had 340 live AI use cases across the entire bank, which were busy making “meaningful gains in efficiency and productivity”.

UBS is hardly an outlier. In March 2025, the New York Post reported <https://nypost.com/2025/03/14/business/jpmorgan-credits-coding-assistant-tool-for-boosting-engineers-efficiency/> that JPMorgan had around 450 potential AI use cases in the works, and that the bank was expecting that number to reach 1,000 by “next year”. That is, this year.

Bank of America also noted during its investor day <https://investor.bankofamerica.com/events-and-presentations/investor-day> in November last year that it had more than “270 AI & machine learning models”, on top of its more than 1,500 AI & machine learning granted patents. Whatever number you pick, Macquarie’s offering seems a bit scant. 

Macquarie’s investment bank, MacCap, also did well. The bank credited investment-related income from asset realization, as well as private credit for the success, while noting “lower fee and commission income.” It also noted its plan was to invest in “accelerating research with advanced AI tools”, without disclosing and use cases numbers.

            <title>Deep down in the UBS MD list </title>

            <description><![CDATA[Late last week, UBS announced its managing directors for 2026. <https://www.ubs.com/global/en/careers.html?sprinklrpostid=100009701149326#md> They were not so many: 155 people there were promoted, down from 208 in the crazy days of 2021. </news/ubs-md-list> 

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

In the preamble to this year's list, UBS said the geographic dispersal of its new MDs reflected its regional growth ambitions. Accordingly, while 43 people in the new UBS MD class are in Switzerland, 40 are in Asia, and only 36 are each in the Americas and Europe. 

Who were they? We've belatedly added the full list below. Here, too, is some detail.

UBS promoted an array of AI experts 

We are in an AI age and UBS has been promoting its AI people. Its promotions include Antoine Bechault in Switzerland, who says he's "transforming group finance through AI driven strategy," Umish Mohite, the asset management CTO lead for cloud and AI, and Musa Parmaksiz who is found in the "AI Center of Excellence."

Tangentially, UBS also promoted Sameer Bakshi, CEO of the finance function where the AI strategy is being implemented. 

UBS promoted a few financial sponsors and leveraged finance bankers

Last summer UBS reorganised its financial sponsors </news/ubs-s-m-and-a-bankers-had-a-bad-quarter-but-someone-s-getting-paid> and M&A teams into a single group while surprisingly (to some) letting none of its financial sponsors bankers go. 

Last week, UBS promoted some more sponsors bankers in the form of Darren Kirke in Australia, and Andrew Emmett and Tomas Dicpinigaitis in New York.

Also promoted was Kanika Chaudhry in leveraged debt capital markets in London. And John Yiannoullou, a former financing banker who's now global banking COO for the Americas.

UBS promoted some M&A loyalists 

Various M&A bankers were promoted alongside financial sponsors bankers. Many have been at the Swiss bank for years.

In London, they included Aamer Bhatti a who's been there since 2019 after joining from Warwick Business School, and Meera Sheff, who's been there since 2011. In the US, they included Whitney Mikell, a real estate, lodging and leisure banker who joined in 2012.  

We didn't spy many ex-Credit Suisse bankers among the new MDs, except for Emil Strand, who appeared in the New York industrials group via Credit Suisse in 2023. 

UBS promoted ahead of the hoped-for recovery in IPOs

2025 was not a good year for IPOs but UBS nonetheless promoted Clara Comellini in EMEA equity capital markets, plus Marco Guarino, its head of EMEA equity syndicate and Rajan Sharma, its head of syndicate in Asia. Peter Castoro, the New York based head of healthcare ECM, who was hired from JPMorgan last August, is on the list too.

A scattering of equity researchers made cut, including Josh Spector, a chemicals researcher in New York and Daniel Major, a metals and mining analyst in London. Contrary to speculation by some, Rory McKenzie, head of businesses services research, wasn't promoted. McKenzie's wife, Helen Brand is the deputy head of EMEA research, but McKenzie has an entirely separate reporting line. 

UBS promoted various Asian bankers 

UBS's Asian bankers are understood to have received its highest bonus increases </news/everything-we-know-about-2026-bonuses-by-bank> this year. Its recent Asia-based MD promotions include Fabrice Delacroix, the head of Asian renewables banking, Chaoxiang Jia in Hong Kong and Tra Zboinski, the head of Vietnam coverage.  

UBS promoted its head of US ETF trading and senior quants

In equities, the promotions include Kudzai Ndondo, the head of Americas EFT trading, Ciprian Ticula, the head of US equity quants and Davide Montoni, the head of Americas quantitative investment strategies and equity derivative sales. In Europe, UBS promoted François-Xavier Lefèvre, its EMEA head of equity derivative flow sales.

In China UBS promoted Jun Yin, its Shanghai-based head of electronic trading.

Where were the promotions in fixed income trading?

UBS MD promotions seemed most sparse in fixed income sales and trading. Andrew Sugden in FX options trading was promoted, as was Paul Buttenmueller, the Singapore-based global head of eFX trading.

However, we didn't see any promotions on the London rates desk, which has lost various people </news/ubs-markets-bonuses> and doesn't seem inclined to replace them internally. "Everyone is too junior or too new," observes one insider.

            <description><![CDATA[Technically speaking, venture capital is a subset of private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity>: like big private equity (PE) firms, venture capital firms invested in companies that aren't publicly traded on a stock exchange. But working for a VC firm is a wildly different experience to a career in the likes of Blackstone </news/blackstone-pay-london> or Carlyle. </news/pay-carlyle-private-equity> This week was the LSE Alternate Investments Conference (AIC) where professionals from various private markets industries educate students on their respective fields. Multiple VC professionals told students about the work you'll do in venture capital and the traits you'll need to possess to thrive in it.

Follow eFinancialCareers on Google News here. <https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV1ZtYVc1aGJtTnBZV3hqWVhKbFpYSnpMbU52YlNnQVAB?ceid=GB:en&oc=3> 

What is venture capital?

Venture capital firms traditionally invest in early-stage companies, taking a minor ownership stake alongside various other investors. Traditional PE firms, by contrast, tend to invest in more mature companies, and take majority stakes in their portfolio companies. PE firms tend to have more specialisation, at least on a fund-by-fund basis, while VCs are more generalist.

The biggest difference between VCs and PE firms, though, is the level of support they claim to provide for founders. Luke Pappas, partner at New Enterprise Associates, said at the AIC that VC is all about "look[ing] for the secret sauce in the founding team" and having "conviction that this team is going to be the one to change things." That conviction is necessary because "all the companies we're interested in are inherently unprofitable for the first few years."

VCs have a reputation for inflating the valuations of their portfolio companies. Pappas said "many of my hedge fund </news/all-the-jobs-in-hedge-funds> friends and private equity  </news/private-equity-job-titles>friends will ping me and tell me that we're not very rational in our pricing." He said that many of the best investments in VC are blink-and-you'll-miss-it, however, and that accepting an inflated valuation is necessary; "if this company ultimately becomes a $10bn company in the long run, it won't matter much."

Fundraising in VC isn't what it used to be, however. A report <https://carta.com/data/resources/state-of-startups-2025/> from accounting infrastructure firm Carta estimated that there was a total of $110bn in startup investments through its platform last year, down from a high of $220.3bn in 2021. The Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/u-s-venture-capital-fundraising-falls-35-as-firms-stay-private-longer-601d6629?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcmJtMGn0708IAAmI57STH_eJb-ZpWCi2dm2FEv_voBf6NEOr6LmFjk3u3X87w%3D&gaa_ts=698b69de&gaa_sig=ALXM_v5jL_2zYlZQYKuVxfcSXddtxZ2L-MRAnKSn21V__rbOS6mYZkhHRON4aBo2_63ubQv_vi3c6UbTgj-ZZA%3D%3D> reported last month that fundraising for US VC firms in 2025 was the lowest it had been for six years. Funds have a lot less margin for error, which is putting increased pressure on VC professionals.

What do you do in venture capital?

"VC's are not glamorous," said Antler partner Hannah Leach at the AIC. "It's honestly a lot of admin." You'll be sitting in numerous meetings for your portfolio companies and researching new ones. Leach said "you need to be adept at sending a cold email </news/finance/cold-email-investment-banking-job>" if you want to win new business.

Your job is to see through the noise in the startup world. Pappas said that "every day, I open up my news app and see 15 different products that people say are changing the world." Leach said that VC is all about doing your homework and "go[ing] into conversations well-informed regardless of asset class."  

Cherry Ventures principal Nadja Reischel said that you have to look for "founders who are super obsessed with the product," as that obsession will carry them through the next ten years of working in their startup. You'll also need to gauge their learning speed and commercial instinct; "you want people who are talking to not 20 but 2,000 potential customers," Reischel said.

All of this typically translates to long hours. Leach said that "work-life balance doesn't quite exist in VC... you need to want to get up at 7am and work through to midnight." Reischel said that "venture is pretty much 24/7" and suggested that she hasn't taken a Sunday off since she joined her firm.

What skills and experience are VC firms looking for?

To succeed in VC, you need to be a people person, but there's more to it than that.

Pappas said that you're a good fit for VC if your "brain likes to context switch a lot of times," as you'll be working across a wide range of products and teams. Leach said you also "need to be good at psychology." We recently held an AMA <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/t/ama-im-the-managing-director-of-newton-venture-program-a-vc-education-program/4767> with Shayan Roy Chowdhury, MD of VC education platform, the Newton Venture Program; he said that the most important skills are "critical thinking, ability to think big, relationship building, time management, and clarity of communication."

As with their founders, VC firms also want their employees to be passionate. Pappas said that, if you're not, "there's going to be 1,000 people who are genuinely interested and they will outperform you." Leach said that demonstrating your passion is particularly hard as a graduate, but suggested building a "shadow portfolio of companies you think will do very well" to stand out.

Having a financial background isn't always necessary. Speaking at the AIC in 2024, LocalGlobe partner Mish Mashkautsan said "template paths" like banking or consulting </news/pay-mckinsey-bain-bcg-big-four> are "uninspiring" as routes into VC. Instead, he said "the best thing you can do is take a bet on yourself." Chowdhury said in our AMA that many people join VCs after working in a startup in a role like a founder's associate </news/the-most-exciting-and-bizarre-job-for-24-year-olds-at-revolut-and-other-fintechs> or chief of staff. One ex-banker in VC previously told us </news/2020/11/how-to-move-out-of-banking-and-into-venture-capital> that big name brands are much more important for getting a VC job in Europe than they are in America. 

What jobs are available in VC?

Unlike PE, most venture capital firms do not have robust intern or graduate recruitment programs. There are exceptions, like Bessemer Ventures' analyst program, but, you'll likely have to monitor the recruiting pages of the firms you're interested in. 

There aren't that many VC jobs available, even at the top firms. Andreessen Horowitz, for example, is one of the largest firms but only has 23 current openings. Y Combinator, another major VC, has just five openings. Sequoia Capital has no current openings. Roles in VC are extremely oversubscribed, so you'll need to rely on connections where possible. If you're a right fit for the people-centric world of VC, that shouldn't be hard.

How much do VC jobs pay?

A recent salary survey <https://www.newcomer.co/p/heres-what-your-fellow-venture-capitalists?utm_source=substack&publication_id=82416&post_id=186864407&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share> from Venture5 found that analysts in VC earn $80k on average. You'll earn $130k-150k as an associate, ~$200k as a mid-level professional, </news/2023/01/venture-capitalism-jobs> then over $300k on average if you can make partner.

A key appeal of working in PE (and thus VC) is the opportunity to earn carried interest, </news/what-is-carried-interest> which is a percentage of the profits should a portfolio company have a large enough exit. Only 24% of analysts reported that they earned carry, however.

As a partner, pay depends on how large your fund is. The survey found that partners at VC funds with more than $500bn in AUM earned $585k in total compensation. When AUM was $250-500bn, average compensation was $402k.

            <description><![CDATA[Technically speaking, venture capital is a subset of private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity>: like big private equity (PE) firms, venture capital firms invested in companies that aren't publicly traded on a stock exchange. But working for a VC firm is a wildly different experience to a career in the likes of Blackstone </news/blackstone-pay-london> or Carlyle. </news/pay-carlyle-private-equity> This week was the LSE Alternate Investments Conference (AIC) where professionals from various private markets industries educate students on their respective fields. Multiple VC professionals told students about the work you'll do in venture capital and the traits you'll need to possess to thrive in it.

What is venture capital?

Venture capital firms traditionally invest in early-stage companies, taking a minor ownership stake alongside various other investors. Traditional PE firms, by contrast, tend to invest in more mature companies, and take majority stakes in their portfolio companies. PE firms tend to have more specialisation, at least on a fund-by-fund basis, while VCs are more generalist.

The biggest difference between VCs and PE firms, though, is the level of support they claim to provide for founders. Luke Pappas, partner at New Enterprise Associates, said at the AIC that VC is all about "look[ing] for the secret sauce in the founding team" and having "conviction that this team is going to be the one to change things." That conviction is necessary because "all the companies we're interested in are inherently unprofitable for the first few years."

VCs have a reputation for inflating the valuations of their portfolio companies. Pappas said "many of my hedge fund </news/all-the-jobs-in-hedge-funds> friends and private equity  </news/private-equity-job-titles>friends will ping me and tell me that we're not very rational in our pricing." He said that many of the best investments in VC are blink-and-you'll-miss-it, however, and that accepting an inflated valuation is necessary; "if this company ultimately becomes a $10bn company in the long run, it won't matter much."

Fundraising in VC isn't what it used to be, however. A report <https://carta.com/data/resources/state-of-startups-2025/> from accounting infrastructure firm Carta estimated that there was a total of $110bn in startup investments through its platform last year, down from a high of $220.3bn in 2021. The Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/u-s-venture-capital-fundraising-falls-35-as-firms-stay-private-longer-601d6629?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcmJtMGn0708IAAmI57STH_eJb-ZpWCi2dm2FEv_voBf6NEOr6LmFjk3u3X87w%3D&gaa_ts=698b69de&gaa_sig=ALXM_v5jL_2zYlZQYKuVxfcSXddtxZ2L-MRAnKSn21V__rbOS6mYZkhHRON4aBo2_63ubQv_vi3c6UbTgj-ZZA%3D%3D> reported last month that fundraising for US VC firms in 2025 was the lowest it had been for six years. Funds have a lot less margin for error, which is putting increased pressure on VC professionals.

What do you do in venture capital?

"VC's are not glamorous," said Antler partner Hannah Leach at the AIC. "It's honestly a lot of admin." You'll be sitting in numerous meetings for your portfolio companies and researching new ones. Leach said "you need to be adept at sending a cold email </news/finance/cold-email-investment-banking-job>" if you want to win new business.

Your job is to see through the noise in the startup world. Pappas said that "every day, I open up my news app and see 15 different products that people say are changing the world." Leach said that VC is all about doing your homework and "go[ing] into conversations well-informed regardless of asset class."  

Cherry Ventures principal Nadja Reischel said that you have to look for "founders who are super obsessed with the product," as that obsession will carry them through the next ten years of working in their startup. You'll also need to gauge their learning speed and commercial instinct; "you want people who are talking to not 20 but 2,000 potential customers," Reischel said.

All of this typically translates to long hours. Leach said that "work-life balance doesn't quite exist in VC... you need to want to get up at 7am and work through to midnight." Reischel said that "venture is pretty much 24/7" and suggested that she hasn't taken a Sunday off since she joined her firm.

What skills and experience are VC firms looking for?

To succeed in VC, you need to be a people person, but there's more to it than that.

Pappas said that you're a good fit for VC if your "brain likes to context switch a lot of times," as you'll be working across a wide range of products and teams. Leach said you also "need to be good at psychology." We recently held an AMA <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/t/ama-im-the-managing-director-of-newton-venture-program-a-vc-education-program/4767> with Shayan Roy Chowdhury, MD of VC education platform, the Newton Venture Program; he said that the most important skills are "critical thinking, ability to think big, relationship building, time management, and clarity of communication."

As with their founders, VC firms also want their employees to be passionate. Pappas said that, if you're not, "there's going to be 1,000 people who are genuinely interested and they will outperform you." Leach said that demonstrating your passion is particularly hard as a graduate, but suggested building a "shadow portfolio of companies you think will do very well" to stand out.

Having a financial background isn't always necessary. Speaking at the AIC in 2024, LocalGlobe partner Mish Mashkautsan said "template paths" like banking or consulting </news/pay-mckinsey-bain-bcg-big-four> are "uninspiring" as routes into VC. Instead, he said "the best thing you can do is take a bet on yourself." Chowdhury said in our AMA that many people join VCs after working in a startup in a role like a founder's associate </news/the-most-exciting-and-bizarre-job-for-24-year-olds-at-revolut-and-other-fintechs> or chief of staff. One ex-banker in VC previously told us </news/2020/11/how-to-move-out-of-banking-and-into-venture-capital> that big name brands are much more important for getting a VC job in Europe than they are in America. 

What jobs are available in VC?

Unlike PE, most venture capital firms do not have robust intern or graduate recruitment programs. There are exceptions, like Bessemer Ventures' analyst program, but, you'll likely have to monitor the recruiting pages of the firms you're interested in. 

There aren't that many VC jobs available, even at the top firms. Andreessen Horowitz, for example, is one of the largest firms but only has 23 current openings. Y Combinator, another major VC, has just five openings. Sequoia Capital has no current openings. Roles in VC are extremely oversubscribed, so you'll need to rely on connections where possible. If you're a right fit for the people-centric world of VC, that shouldn't be hard.

How much do VC jobs pay?

A recent salary survey <https://www.newcomer.co/p/heres-what-your-fellow-venture-capitalists?utm_source=substack&publication_id=82416&post_id=186864407&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share> from Venture5 found that analysts in VC earn $80k on average. You'll earn $130k-150k as an associate, ~$200k as a mid-level professional, </news/2023/01/venture-capitalism-jobs> then over $300k on average if you can make partner.

A key appeal of working in PE (and thus VC) is the opportunity to earn carried interest, </news/what-is-carried-interest> which is a percentage of the profits should a portfolio company have a large enough exit. Only 24% of analysts reported that they earned carry, however.

As a partner, pay depends on how large your fund is. The survey found that partners at VC funds with more than $500bn in AUM earned $585k in total compensation. When AUM was $250-500bn, average compensation was $402k.

            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/GTeaL9wbSyyttPkpwSPZ" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[How was your bonus </news/banker-bonuses> for last year? If you're at a European bank, excepting UBS </news/ubs-markets-bonuses> and Barclays, </news/barclays-bonuses-2026> you may not know yet. Nor will you know if you are with the Japanese. If you're at a US bank and you were paid up by less than 10%, then bad luck.

The general verdict is that this year's bonus round has been good, but that it might have been better. "Expectations did not match reality as all bankers expected to be highly compensated at all levels and this was not the case," says Mike Karp, CEO and founder of search firm Options Group. In sales and trading </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank>, Karp says some people did "very well indeed." However, traders say this year's bonuses were even more heavily skewed towards performance than usual. 

Within sales and trading, macro traders had a particularly strong 2025, with most US banks citing strong growth in macro revenues in the fourth quarter. Macro bonus pools are thought to to be up 8-12% as a result. Credit bonuses are understood to be less strong, with pools up 5-10% or less.

Below is what we know on bonuses by bank. This has not been validated by the banks concerned, who typically do not comment on compensation. If you have anything to add, please add a comment, or venture into the Bubble  <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/>where discussion is free.

Bank of America bonuses 

Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-06/goldman-jpmorgan-bankers-see-bonus-pools-rise-at-least-10> says BofA's bonus pool was up 10% this year. However, top ranked associates at Bank of America say they received bonuses  </news/bank-of-america-associates-got-their-bonuses-and-they-feel-nostalgic>equivalent to 75% of salaries and that this was disappointing as they were receiving 110% not so long ago. BofA associates </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds> also complain that they are receiving 30% of their bonuses in stock that vests over a four year period.

In December, Reuters <https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/bofa-bonuses-will-jump-investment-bankers-this-year-sources-say-2025-12-19/> reported that BofA intended to increase bonuses by 20% for its investment bankers. Asia-based bonuses are thought to have come closest to this approximation. BofA's markets bonuses </news/bank-of-america-bonuses-are-out-they-may-be-moderately-good> are thought to have been up by less.  There has been some griping <https://efinancialcareers.com/news/at-bank-of-america-some-equities-traders-would-like-bigger-bonuses#:~:text=BofA's%20equities%20insiders%20say%20they,under-compensated%20relative%20to%20workload.> in areas like EMEA equities (and particularly in equity research), where insiders say they exceeded their 2025 budget in September but received bonus increases of only a few percentage points. There are suggestions that the EMEA markets business helped subsidize the US this year.

Barclays bonuses 

Today is bonus day at Barclays. As we reported earlier </news/barclays-bonuses-2026>, 1,465 senior staff categorised as material risk takers at the British bank received a 16% increase in their average bonus to £900k ($1.2m). Barclays' remaining 91,500 staff may not have done badly either: Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/barclays-lifts-bonus-pool-across-bank-by-15-to-2-2-billlion?utm_medium=email&utm_source=author_alert&utm_term=260210&utm_campaign=author_21061455>notes that bonuses across the bank are up 15% and that many junior staff received £500 share awards.

All this sounds positive, but some people at Barclays seem to be whinging all the same. Maybe the pool was skewed towards the 718 people paid over €1m, and the 89 of them paid over €4m.

BNP Paribas bonuses 

BNP Paribas has not announced its bonuses yet. The French bank doesn't break out compensation spending in its corporate and investment bank, but operating expenses in the division rose only 3% last year and fell in the final quarter when bonuses are typically calibrated. 

While none of this bodes well,  </news/bnp-q4-2025>Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-06/bnp-paribas-considers-raising-trader-bonus-pool-by-close-to-10> reported last week that BNP Paribas is considering increases bonuses in its markets division by 10%. 

Last year, the average bonus </news/bnp-paribas-bonuses> for material risk takers at the French bank's CIB was €678k. This year, senior BNP traders could cautiously budget for €750k. M&A bankers will seemingly get less.

Citi bonuses 

Citi bonuses have been "mixed," say insiders. This is the nature of the beast, but at Citi some factors have contributed to this.

At the top end in London, Citi invited its material risk takers (MDs and other senior people) to sign new contracts </news/citi-salaries-london> at the end of last year. These contracts locked in small salaries and larger bonuses, adding a greater element of variability to pay. Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/citigroup-hikes-bonuses-for-london-dealmakers-by-up-to-15-1388b8ed> reported that some London bankers then received bonus hikes of 10-15% and that some got 20%.

Not everyone was treated this generously though. In the markets business, some Citi traders have complained of being zeroed </news/citi-cutting-jobs-bonuses> and having bonuses halved. Citi is cutting jobs and there are suggestions that swathes of people were intentionally disappointed in the hope that they might leave of their own accords.

Deutsche Bank bonuses 

Deutsche Bank doesn't announce bonuses until March, by which time it will have been able to take good stock of how much everyone else is paying. Last year, it paid material risk takers average bonuses of $1.1m </news/barclays-hsbc-deutsche-bank-bnp-paribas-socgen-ubs-pay> and the bonus pool for investment bankers and traders rose by 32%.  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/deutsche-bank-boosts-bonus-pool-to-2-5-billion-most-since-2014>

Goldman Sachs bonuses

People at Goldman are understood to be variably happy. Goldman bankers are understood to be happiest of all, markets professionals quite happy, and middle and back office  </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking>staff ambivalent-to-sad.  

One senior technologist at Goldman told us </news/goldman-sachs-and-morgan-stanley-people-complain-of-poor-bonuses-away-from-the-front-office> engineering and operations </news/operations-jobs-banking> bonuses were "hit badly" in a possible attempt to encourage people to leave. Overall, Bloomberg says the pool at Goldman was 10% higher.

HSBC bonuses 

HSBC won't announce bonuses until later this month, but things do not sound promising. Bloomberg reported last week </news/hsbc-s-zero-bonuses-risk-upsetting-already-traumatised-bankers> that the bank is planning to allocate zeroes and to an operate an eat what you kill model. There is apprehension internally about what this will entail.

JPMorgan bonuses 

JPMorgan bonuses are understood to have been "good". Bloomberg says JPMorgan's pool was also 10% up.

Morgan Stanley bonuses 

Morgan Stanley is understood </news/goldman-sachs-and-morgan-stanley-people-complain-of-poor-bonuses-away-from-the-front-office> to have paid its bankers well, especially in Asia, but there have been simultaneous complaints of poor pay in the middle and back office, where some staff are claiming that they've been shifted onto a salary heavy structure without any appreciable increase in salary.

UBS bonuses 

UBS has yet to publish details of the bonuses it paid "key risk takers" for last year, but early indications are that people were mostly happy. Everyone we have spoken to said bonuses were "fine," </news/ubs-markets-bonuses> with double digit increases in the markets pool being mooted. Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/ubs-investment-bank-units-to-see-bonus-pools-jump-by-up-to-20>reported that some units saw 20% increases in the bonus pool and that UBS's Asian banking bonuses were up 18%.

            <description><![CDATA[You don’t need a big team to manage a lot of money. Just look at some of the world’s littlest tiniest hedge funds </news/small-hedge-funds>, which manage tens of billion of dollars of capital. And it’s not a phenomenon limited to the hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> world, either.

Speaking at the LSE’s Alternative Investments Conference, Kate Stewart – a VP in the investments team of private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> firm Pantheon Ventures – laid out the firm’s structure for students interested in working at the firm.

Stewart explained that Pantheon, whose private equity arm manages $20bn in assets, employs an investment team of less than 80 people, spread across six global offices: London, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

Interestingly, the composition of those 79 people is rather… Top heavy. Pantheon employs 15 Partner tier in its PE team, 6 managing directors (MDs), and 6 Principals (Director-level professionals). Less than half of its team are actual number crunchers, including 11 VPs, 9 senior associates, and around 7/8 associates and analysts.

That’s very different to how a bigger company would structure its headcount. At Deutsche Bank </news/deutsche-bank-juniors-say-they-re-being-suffocated-by-a-surfeit-of-m-ds> in London, for example, professionals of director rank and above make up 29% of headcount – at Pantheon, that number is 35%. Managing director and above are 8% of Deutsche Bank’s London office, compared to 27% at Pantheon.

Of course, Pantheon’s figures only include its investment team. Stewart also noted that it had numerous other teams dedicated to investor relations, as well as “dedicated teams focused on deal structuring, tax structuring and sustainability” that weren’t counted. And that’s not to mention a “large back office </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking> which focus on areas like legal, compliance </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-compliance>, finance </news/accounting-job-finance-banking>.”

What does that sort of throughput lead to? Well, since 2014, Pantheon has raised $12bn in capital, screened over 3,000 funds, and currently holds over 500 advisory seats. The firm has also made over 1,000 commitments (investments) since 1992.

After just shy of two decades at one of London's largest trading firms, a senior engineer </news/how-to-get-a-technology-job-bank> has opted to work in motorsports instead.

Chris Ramshaw is joining PACETEQ GmbH as its head of software. According to his LinkedIn, he spent 17 years at G-Research </news/g-research-pay>, predominantly as a software development manager after joining from Citi. Later in his tenure, he also worked in operations analysis and became the principal customer representative for its trading platform. 

Paceteq was co-founded by F1 quant pioneer Neil Martin, formerly head strategist for Ferrari. It focuses on providing real-time data insights for motorsports using AI, with plans to expand into more sports, including cycling and football </news/2023/09/football-to-banking>.

Ramshaw is a bit of an outlier in that other senior hires tend to already be in the world of motorsports. In October, for example, it hired Albert Lau as a VP of product; he was most recently chief engineer for NEOM McLaren's Formula E racing team.

The sound and the fury may pass, though. At JPMorgan, where people are now in the office five days a week </news/jpmorgan-return-to-office-five-days> and employees initially complained <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-employees-gripe-about-dimons-return-to-office-edict-2023-04-27/> that management was "tone deaf" and divisive, the complaining has fizzled out.

The Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/f1f95f01-bd05-4a92-9222-4ddd3d356bb1> reports that only 2,000 of JPMorgan's 300,000 global employees have signed a petition against homeworking; less than 1% of the total. This time last year, the petition had 1,200 signatures. Growth is not exponential.

The remaining 99% of non-signatories are either happy to be in the office five days a week or quietly resigned to their fates. One of them tells the FT it would be "career suicide" to publicly complain. This is not irrational. When the petition was launched, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon publicly declared, </news/jamie-dimon-work-from-home-jpmorgan> “Don’t waste time on it … I don’t care how many people sign that f—ing petition.” Last year, Nicholas Welch, <https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/business/jpmorgan-analyst-who-slammed-jamie-dimon-over-rto-is-apparently-author-of-reddit-rants-against-ceo/> a technology support analyst at JPMorgan was fired and then rehired for publicly challenging the return to office mandate. Welch was subsequently outed for posting rants against Dimon on Reddit (now deleted <https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1jium04/hey_there_uncle_jamie/>) and his whereabouts is unknown. 

The suppression of return to office whinging is not the same as people joyfully sitting at their desks, though. At banks like SocGen </news/soc-gen-insiders-say-there-was-an-awkward-townhall-about-returning-to-the-office>, where people are now expected in the office four days a week, employees have taken to calling CEO Slawomir Krupa "Captain Krupa" in an act of minor defiance. Last June, Krupa declared that “people on a screen” were “not part of meetings”, the FT notes. 

Separately, Mark Mason is stepping down as Citi CFO, but he is doing so in incremental steps over a four month period. Diego De Giorgi is also stepping down at Standard Chartered, but he is doing so immediately.

De Giorgi is going to Apollo, where he will be head of Europe. Standard Chartered announced <https://www.sc.com/en/press-release/appointment-of-peter-burrill-as-interim-group-chief-financial-officer/> De Giorgi's unexpected leap at 5am this morning and said he is going with "immediate effect." Reuters <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/standard-chartered-names-peter-burrill-interim-cfo-2026-02-10/> notes that Standard Chartered's shares fell 4.1% at the open. De Giorgi was expected to replace Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters. Now he's found something better instead.

Marc Rowan at Apollo says the group will outpeform rivals in the future as it didn't invest in software companies hit by concerns about AI. “I expect that we will be, along with a handful of other managers, prettier than we have been historically.” (Financial Times)  <https://www.ft.com/content/7302e0ba-43a5-4e46-8d23-c98bb7ced025>

Everyone wants to work in secondaries, says Todd Miller at Jefferies. "It's a very hot industry. Everyone's trying to get into this space. I get a massive amount of inbounds on LinkedIn.

They want to do this job."(Business Insider)  <https://www.businessinsider.com/investment-banking-advising-secondaries-became-hottest-job-wall-street-2026-2>

Morgan Stanley junior points out the uses of AI: “We have hundreds upon hundreds of deal folders, with decades of models and analysis and PowerPoints, and truly everything you do in banking could be aided by finding precedent analysis.

The trouble with jobs in private equity: "Junior guys hustle to find deals while senior guys decide which ones they like without being close enough to make the right decisions.

Filings  <https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/ResultAnnouncements/FullYear2025Results/FY25-BPLC-Pillar-3.pdf>accompanying the British bank's fourth quarter results show that material risk takers at Barclays' investment bank </news/what-is-an-investment-bank> received their highest bonuses, </news/banker-bonuses> on average, for six years in compensation for 2025. This was despite a feeble year for its investment bankers.

Barclays employs 1,465 material risk takers in its investment bank and it paid them a total of £732m ($1m) in bonuses, or £901k each. Six years ago, the average bonus for Barclays' MRTs was £557k.

Barclays investment bank MRTs also received salaries averarging £652k, leading to a total package of £1.6m.

Barclays' generosity followed a feeble year for its bankers, in which M&A </news/get-a-job-in-ma> fees increased only 2%, equity capital markets fees fell 21% and debt capital markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> fees rose 1%. The bank's global share of investment banking fees fell from 3.3% in 2024 to 3% in 2025 as a result. 

Despite this, Barclays continues to talk of pivoting to an advisory based model and growing its investment banking operations. By 2028, it aspires to boost its share of global investment banking fees to 3.5%.

While Barclays bankers floundered, its salespeople and traders </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank> maintained their own share of global revenues at 6.5%. Barclays said today that macro, securitised products and credit trading were strong last year, as was prime financing.

Although the average Barclays investment bank MRT (including, bankers and markets professionals) received a £900k bonus for last year, bonuses will not have been allocated equally. As the chart below shows, across the bank as a whole, bonuses were skewed towards top performers as ever last year. 

762 people across the bank earned over €1 last year. Someone earned €17m-18m. 89 people at Barclays earned over €3.9m compared to 60 in 2024.

            <title>Morgan Stanley&#39;s Michael Grimes, the $10.5m salary and the $56m stock bonus </title>

            <description><![CDATA[Michael Grimes is back at Morgan Stanley. The Financial Times  <https://www.ft.com/content/7d960fcc-c80f-4c12-8b8e-1fd41fc7a444>reported today that Grimes has returned from his long year in the Trump Administration. 

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Instead of simply being a managing director (MD) and co-head of technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley as he was before, Grimes will now be the bank's group chair of investment banking. In this new role, Morgan Stanley says Grimes will apply his expertise to  "the full banking and [institutional securities group] franchise, particularly as technology transforms productivity and impacts global industrial policy." 

Now that Grimes is back in the room, it's worth remembering that he was never a standard investment banker anyway. In the public financial disclosure report <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25969697-grimes-michael-d-278e278t-2025/> that Grimes filed when he joined the government in 2025, he revealed a $10.5m Morgan Stanley salary and $56m of Morgan Stanley bonuses that had been deferred during the previous three years. By comparison, H1B Visa filings suggest the average salary for an MD at Morgan Stanley is closer to $400k. 

As we reported last April, </news/michael-grimes-banker> Grimes received other special dispensations during his 30 year career with the bank. He was, for example, permitted to avoid Morgan Stanley's management committees and firmwide strategy sessions, and encouraged to simply originate deals. He did this successfully, working on the IPOs of Facebook and Airbnb and cultivating a strong relationship with Elon Musk.

Musk is coincidentally considering a $1.5 trillion IPO for SpaceX this summer, and the FT notes that Grimes' return leaves Morgan Stanley well-placed to win a leading role. If so, Grimes' next bonus at Morgan Stanley could be far higher than his last one.

Grimes doesn't really need the money. As is always the case when bankers leave for government roles, Grimes benefited from the accelerated vesting </news/jamie-dimon-donald-trump> of his $56m of Morgan Stanley stock, which became accessible all at once instead of in three year tranches when he left for Trump. He will also have avoided capital gains tax if his deferred stock were reinvested in US treasuries or diversified funds. 

Grimes wasn't really suited to government jobs. When he worked on a purge of the Chips Program Office last year, government employees complained </news/michael-grimes> of his manner and said it wasn't a "psychologically healthy place to work." Back at Morgan Stanley, Grimes can now be as brusque as he likes, so long as he delivers the SpaceX IPO.

            <description><![CDATA[Balyasny Asset Management </news/london-pay-balyasny> (BAM) had a good year in 2025. The hedge fund </news/all-the-jobs-in-hedge-funds> posted 16.7% returns, more than the likes of Millennium </news/how-to-get-a-job-at-hedge-fund-millennium> and Citadel,  </news/2022/10/how-to-get-a-job-at-citadel>and it's looking to grow further in 2026. Speaking on the Generating Alpha podcast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1M8y4QybU8> over the weekend, founder Dimitry Balyasny </news/dmitry-balyasny-hedge-fund> revealed what it takes to belong at BAM.

What intern and graduate opportunities are there at Balyasny?

Balyasny said that the fund hired ~100 interns last year (more than previously projected </news/balyasny-internship>), and that next year's intake is "probably going to be 130-140 globally." The fund has a pretty good retention rate, hiring 65% of its interns </news/internship-investment-bank> full-time according to Balyasny, but what does it take to be chosen in the first place?

Balyasny said these interns </news/hedge-funds-with-graduate-training-programmes> "come in from all the top schools, investment clubs and math programs," and work across various departments including tech, risk </news/risk-job-investment-bank> and trading. 'Top schools </news/2016/08/the-top-20-universities-for-getting-a-hedge-fund-job>' presumably include the likes of Princeton, NYU and MIT, where Balyasny himself previously traveled </news/2023/12/balyasny-campus-recruitment> to talk to students. 

If you join BAM full-time via its analyst program, Balyasny said that your relationship with your portfolio manager </news/2023/09/portfolio-manager-job-hedge-fund> (PM) becomes similar to that of a padawan and a Jedi master from Star Wars: “You’ve got to like and respect your Jedi and think that’s somebody you could learn a lot from," he said.

What do investment analysts and portfolio managers do at Balyasny?

There's a lot of similarities between the PMs and investment analysts </news/what-is-a-hedge-fund-analyst-a-day-in-the-life-of-an-equities-analyst-at-citadel> that BAM is hiring. Balyasny said that both analysts and PMs need to provide a "consistent flow" of "unique, varying ideas" about things that a lot of people are also looking at. 

Alongside creativity, Balyasny said candidates need "investment discipline." A smart but ill-disciplined analyst, for example, "might fall in love with one idea. They have a hard time running models on 100 different companies."

The big difference between analysts and PMs is "risk tolerance." Balyasny said that PMs "need the ability to juggle lots of different balls." He said that "risk is tough to coach," and that most people have an "innate" level of risk that can be influenced, but not substantially changed. 

What is the right risk profile? Speaking at the LSE Alternate Investments Conference in 2024 </news/dmitry-balyasny-hedge-fund>, Balyasny said it means "enough confidence to take meaningful risk and tolerate the volatility and tolerate drawdowns and not drive yourself crazy." 

If this isn't you, maybe you could be analyst instead. He said on the podcast that "a great thing about being an analyst is you can go super deep on a particular thing and not worry about anything else." As a PM, meanwhile, "every day there's something blowing up your book."

Who is Balyasny Asset Management Hiring?

BAM has been growing its portfolio manager ranks. Balyasny said on the Generating Alpha podcast that the fund has roughly 200 PMs, up from ~175 in August.  </news/where-do-portfolio-managers-work-balyasny>It's not clear where exactly the recent additions were based, but six months ago, the fund had 113 PMs in the US, 39 in EMEA and 24 in Asia.

Balyasny is especially focused on Asia, where revenues were up over 80% last year. Last month, Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/balyasny-asia-revenue-jumps-82-to-record-during-expansion-drive> said BAM had 250 staff in the region across 30 investment teams. It has 23 openings in Asia today, including listings for traders, quants and engineers. 

Last year, BAM made a number of big name hires, including multiple who were going through drawdown periods.  </news/dave-brodsky-balyasny-citadel>Balyasny previously suggested that people are willing to join the fund on lower wages </news/balyasny-pay> than elsewhere because of the strength of the firm's culture. In last week's podcast, he said that top talent are guaranteed high pay </news/hedge-fund-working-hours> at any of the major funds; if a few extra million dollars is "the main thing you’re offering... that’s not really compelling." Despite this, staff in Balyasny's UK entity </news/london-pay-balyasny> had more than double the total compensation per head of most major hedge funds </news/best-paying-hedge-funds> according to their most recent annual accounts via Companies House.

Balyasny said that, when screening candidates, "we look for passion a lot. Is this person super excited to be in this business, in this firm, in this role?” He said that having passion is important to get through those "miserable periods when nothing is working [and] you feel like the biggest idiot in the world."

Balyasny said on the Generating Alpha podcast that the fund has roughly 200 PMs, up from ~175 in August.  </news/where-do-portfolio-managers-work-balyasny>It's not clear where exactly the recent additions were based, but six months ago, the fund had 113 PMs in the US, 39 in EMEA and 24 in Asia.

Balyasny is especially focused on Asia, where revenues were up over 80% last year. Last month, Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/balyasny-asia-revenue-jumps-82-to-record-during-expansion-drive> said BAM had 250 staff in the region across 30 investment teams. It has 23 openings in Asia today, including listings for traders, quants and engineers. 

Last year, BAM made a number of big name hires, including multiple who were going through drawdown periods.  </news/dave-brodsky-balyasny-citadel>Balyasny previously suggested that people are willing to join the fund on lower wages </news/balyasny-pay> than elsewhere because of the strength of the firm's culture. In last week's podcast, he said that top talent are guaranteed high pay </news/hedge-fund-working-hours> at any of the major funds; if a few extra million dollars is "the main thing you’re offering... that’s not really compelling." Despite this, staff in Balyasny's UK entity </news/london-pay-balyasny> had more than double the total compensation per head of most major hedge funds </news/best-paying-hedge-funds> according to their most recent annual accounts via Companies House.

Balyasny said that, when screening candidates, "we look for passion a lot. Is this person super excited to be in this business, in this firm, in this role?” He said that having passion is important to get through those "miserable periods when nothing is working [and] you feel like the biggest idiot in the world."

            <description><![CDATA[Hamza Lemssouguer breeds parrots </news/hamza-lemssouguer>. That’s not typical of a credit trader </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank>, but neither is market performance – or the depth of his wisdom at such a young age.

It probably helps that Lemssouguer, just 35 years old, has been in charge of his own hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> since 2022. Lemssouguer's credit fund Arini (named after the parrots he breeds) Capital, which has gone from strength to strength. It now has $15bn in assets under management and has launched a recent partnership with Lazard <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-10/hedge-funds-hamza-lemssouguer-s-arini-is-dominating-europe-s-distressed-market>, the boutique investment bank </news/boutique-investment-banks>.

Speaking to students at the LSE’s Alternative Investments Conference earlier today,  Lemssouguer admitted that not every day in his career was a win – and neither was that important.

“We don't create anything that is that revolutionary in our job,” Lemssouguer told students. “It's about discipline. It's about waking up every day, doing the same things and then keeping it and improving it. And also accepting that feedback, because ultimately you will be told that you make stupid decisions.”

A lot of bad decisions get made, inevitably. It’s part of the job. And by the time that Lemssouguer checks his phone in the morning, “I probably check that I made five stupid decisions last week, and what's important is to adjust and then move on and continue, not forget about them. You have to adjust, but move on.”

Being able to do that is what makes him a grand slam winner, or whatever the equivalent is in finance. “As Roger Federer said, he only won 54% of the points. He’s possibly the best champion in tennis we've ever seen. It's not about winning every point, it's about winning in general. And part of that winning in general is taking on the losses and adjusting your process,” Lemssouguer explained.

In turn, losses have to be managed in and of themselves. “Losses cannot be terminal. So how can you make sure that losses are not terminal? The initial analysis that you do before investing. Before we invest, and I think before you invest in anything, is think what if this all goes wrong.”

That kind of pessimism is key to working in credit in general. In fact, it differentiates them. Deciding between a career in equities or credit is all about deciding whether “are you – not personally, but professionally – an optimist person or pessimistic person?”, according to Lemssouguer.

Not that you have to be depressed to work in credit – “You can be optimistic in life and pessimistic at work,” Lemssouguer says – but if “you’re an optimistic person in general, and you like to see the dreams and ideas in the upside, credit is probably not the best [for you]. Because credit is really just about getting your money back, and if you dream too much you can get burned. In equities, you need the dream – you cannot be too pessimistic, or you say no to Amazon in the 90’s.”

We spoke to five senior compliance professionals for this article. Their verdicts, imparted anonymously, were the same: the compliance profession is being starved of investment, and it's being felt in compliance jobs and pay. 

"The business is in control," said one long term compliance professional. "Senior managers from the business don't allocate budget to compliance, which is always seen as a cost. It's the first place to be squeezed and we are always under a lot of pressure. You must always be right - if you're wrong you're fired!"

Following years of squeeze, the market is now awash with senior compliance professionals touting their wares. They are finding in the process that it is a buyer's market.

"I am shocked at how salaries across compliance have dramatically dropped," reflected one executive director who left his job after a decade late last year. "Roles that used to pay six figures, now pay £90k, for double the responsibility."

Another compliance said roles that once paid £100k are now paying £80k and that compliance has been particularly hard hit by cost cutting.  "Most firms are offshoring their compliance processes and using AI solutions for monitoring, so there's a lot less demand for people," he added.

The laments come as Goldman Sachs is reportedly <https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2026/02/06/anthropic-goldman-sachs-ai-model-accounting.html?utm_source=www.shortsqueez.co&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=bonus-season-is-back&_bhlid=4e8afcf42e95f2c1874a17b59c272cde916b8f0a> using Claude to automate its compliance and accounting roles. They also come as the Trump presidency has adopted a more lenient regulatory tone and as Chancellor Rachel Reeves has promised  <https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/rachel-reeves-mansion-house-2025-speech>to cut capital requirements and red tape in the UK. "The regulatory environment over the last five years put costs and burdens on the firm that we now won't have going forward," said Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon in January. 

Solomon was referring primarily to capital requirements, but regulatory headcount is falling too. Citi said  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/citi-ceo-warns-of-more-job-cuts-calls-time-on-old-bad-habits>in January that it was 80% of the way through its program to remedy is regulatory failings following its 2020 consent order. <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/citigroup-aims-complete-work-consent-orders-this-year-sources-say-2026-02-06/> Citi has spent $260m </news/citi-hired-an-md-to-fix-its-compliance-issues-as-another-md-returned-to-bof-a>+ to solve its regulatory data issues alone and hired both risk and compliance </news/citi-is-still-out-there-hiring-m-ds-to-work-on-its-consent-order> staff and hundreds of data professionals </news/citi-data-hiring> and thousands of technologists <https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-hiring-4000-technologists-to-institutional-clients-group-strategy-2022-6> to controls in its investment bank. When the remedial program is finished later this year, Citi CEO Jane Fraser suggested some of those staff will be let go again. 

Compliance professionals who are struggling to stay afloat said their profession needs reframing. "I have always faced off to the business," said one. "My mantra is "I help your business make money and avoid regulatory scrutiny and fines" - I make money and reduce risk (saving money)." 

Another said he's looking at contract roles instead. "When you look at the personal liability involved in senior compliance roles and you compare that to the pay, it's not worth it," he said, referring to UK regulations making senior compliance personally liable for regulatory failings. "It's much safer to be a contractor now."

            <description><![CDATA[For all the talk of AI reducing demand for juniors </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds> in investment banks </news/what-is-an-investment-bank>, a new report suggests that 2026 could be a fine year for graduate hiring.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

The latest Graduate Market in 2026 report from research firm High Fliers says investment banks in the UK are planning to recruit 2,365 graduates next year, up from the 2,069 graduates they actually hired in 2025.

If all goes to plan, this could make 2026 one of the best years for graduate hiring for a while. In the nadir of 2021 </news/2021/02/big-four-graduate-applications>, investment banks were only targeting 1,640 hires in the UK.  This year, their aspirations are 26% above that. 

Unfortunately, none of this means that jobs in banking will be any easier to come by. Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers, notes that the increase in graduate hiring by UK banks has coincided with a decrease in graduate hiring elsewhere. 

"The biggest drop over the last three years has been at the accounting and professional service firms. </news/working-for-the-big-four-pwc-deloitte-ey-kpmg> Over three years they are down by about a third relative to where they were in 2022 and 2023," says Birchall. 

The average student now makes 22 job applications but only 25% of them get jobs before leaving university, says Birchall. This means that each cohort of new graduates is up against the unsuccessful graduates from previous years. "You now have three cohorts competing for the same jobs," Birchall observes.

Faced with such harsh conditions, Birchall says students are applying for jobs across the board. "Students aren't thinking what is my ideal career I'll just apply for that," he says. AI is turbocharging mass applications. This is seemingly why banks are registering record high applications and record low acceptance rates </news/graduate-applications-to-banking-jobs> globally.

Birchall says banks' appetite for more graduate hires in 2026 is down to a strong year last year and to wariness about "gaps in talent 3-5 years down the line."

So far, he says there's been no sign that AI is reducing demand for graduates anywhere, citing instead a general malaise. If AI does impact graduate hiring, he's hopeful it won't be dramatic. "When accounting firms offshored jobs in 2010, everyone said it was the end of graduate programmes but they actually used offshoring to turbo charge growth," says Birchall, optimistically.

It just tapped the former European head of a leading US trading </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank> firm to run a new London office.

Graviton Research has hired Ian Jack as its head of Europe, based in London. Jack previously spent six and a half years at Hudson River Trading, where he was CEO of its UK entity, 'Hudson River Trading Europe Ltd </news/hudson-river-trading-pay-uk-high-frequency-trading>.' He left in early 2023, and spent the last two years as a consultant before arriving at Graviton last month. 

A company spokesperson told eFinancialCareers that the firm "recently established a UK affiliate, which will act as a talent hub for European research and development," and that Jack will be leading it. Graviton will be hiring in both the UK and contintental Europe. The firm's site currently only lists three offices; two Indian offices in Gurgaon and GIFT City, as well as an one in Singapore.

Jack isn't the only hire in London, though. Heejin Yoon also joined last month to work on business development after a four-year stint at another electronic trading firm, Maven Securities. </news/maven-securities-hiring>

Graviton was founded by Nishil and Ankit Gupta, both IIT graduates. The former was previously a portfolio management VP at Millennium spinoff WorldQuant while the latter was previously an intern at Deutsche Bank. Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/high-frequency-firms-see-india-profits-surge-despite-regulatory-curbs> reported in November that Graviton's profits for 2025 rose 17% to 11.8n rupees ($130m), making it the top performing India-native HFT.

            <title>Morning Coffee: Goldman Sachs stands by its &#34;feminist&#34; on $23m. Bank CEO lies in until 5am following cancer diagnosis</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/kathryn-ruemmler-goldman-sachs-epstein</link>
            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/eUwr8fyhRjGsKEAmztDg" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[When Goldman Sachs hired Kathryn Ruemmler in 2020, it ran some checks on her past. A spokesman told Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/goldman-defense-of-lawyer-s-epstein-ties-provokes-unease-at-bank>that the firm did its own due diligence and "was satisfied." Six years later, Goldman insists it's satisfied still. But Ruemmler - who earned $22.5m working for the firm in 2024 is testing the definition of contentment.

Ruemmler is one Goldman Sachs most senior women. She joined the firm as head of regulatory affairs and has thrived. These days, she's a member of Goldman Sachs' management committee. She is chief legal officer and general counsel. She's head of Goldman's firmwide conduct committee, which ensures the integrity of its personnel. She is chair of the reputational risk committee, which protects Goldman's reputation. 

Ruemmler is also a close advisor to Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon. Solomon thinks Ruemmler is great. He said recently: “Kathy is an excellent general counsel and we benefit from her advice every day.”

And yet, emails Ruemmler exchanged with Jeffrey Epstein in her pre-Goldman Sachs days are raising eyebrows about who she has dispensed her advice to. The Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/when-the-fbi-arrested-epstein-he-called-kathryn-ruemmler-39f7bf73?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqexN5DyXKKiV_YljQBFjJeph2QS6at-WVIWa1-9l8JmvQTP11mO_9gwnJA3d0k%3D&gaa_ts=6988a5ac&gaa_sig=DSsBBWuyBrHcT6sx_-eaRArRK8U2ZtRhh_Umu5MDUasnnbTUQ-2WDFAcxy61FTUPPKsiZiwFZn5gXTfAbPTjiA%3D%3D> notes that Epstein called Ruemmler when he was arrested in 2018. Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/goldman-defense-of-lawyer-s-epstein-ties-provokes-unease-at-bank> notes that a version of Epstein's 2019 will listed her as a back-up trustee. The New York Post <https://nypost.com/2026/02/06/business/jeffrey-epstein-suggested-top-lawyer-kathryn-ruemmler-advocate-for-him-to-melinda-gates-give-her-the-other-side/> observes that Epstein - in offering to despatch Ruemmler to talk to Bill Gates' wife, called her "an arch feminist who is my great defender." [Gates spokesman said the reference is "absurd" and "completely false."]

Ruemmler strenuously denies any wrongdoing relating to Epstein. The WSJ notes that she never represented him. Ruemmler's spokesperson says she was never Epstein's defender and had no control over how Epstein categorised her. Epstein simply "informally reached out" to Ruemmler for advice, "just as he did with numerous other prominent lawyers throughout the country.” Epstein was a “monster,” said Ruemmler in a statement to Bloomberg last Tuesday; she regrets ever knowing him. She had "no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part.”

Ruemmler's emails to Jeffrey have also emerged in the Department of Justice files <https://www.justice.gov/epstein>. In 2015 she told Epstein's assistant, "I adore him” and offered advice on Epstein's plea agreement, noting that, minors "could not legally consent to engaging in prostitution.”  In 2017 she called him "sweetie". In 2016, the FT <https://www.ft.com/content/a07bb45d-512f-4694-9ce1-355b78131937> notes that Ruemmler and Epstein discussed her getting a job at Citadel and that Ruemmler appeared to jest that Epstein might “trade one of your Russians for my comp.” She didn't end up joining the hedge fund. “You know me well,” she wrote to Epstein in 2019, in emails where she said <https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/when-the-fbi-arrested-epstein-he-called-kathryn-ruemmler-39f7bf73?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqexN5DyXKKiV_YljQBFjJeph2QS6at-WVIWa1-9l8JmvQTP11mO_9gwnJA3d0k%3D&gaa_ts=6988a5ac&gaa_sig=DSsBBWuyBrHcT6sx_-eaRArRK8U2ZtRhh_Umu5MDUasnnbTUQ-2WDFAcxy61FTUPPKsiZiwFZn5gXTfAbPTjiA%3D%3D> she was meeting John Rogers, who was instrumental in hiring her at Goldman Sachs. 

Most controversially, though, Ruemmler received gifts from Epstein. Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/goldman-defense-of-lawyer-s-epstein-ties-provokes-unease-at-bank> notes that these included a $9,400 Hermès bag, a $4,200 Fendi fur-trimmed plaid wool coat and a $1,700 Fendi bag. Bloomberg cites emails suggesting that Epstein's office asked Ruemmler whether she wanted a new band for her Apple Watch and she chose a Hermès one. She chose a date for tickets to the book of Mormon when Epstein offered to buy them. 

A Goldman spokesperson told Bloomberg Epstein often gave unsolicited gifts to his contacts. Ruemmler's spokesperson told Bloomberg, “Ms. Ruemmler didn’t ask for anything and didn’t want anything.” 

Like Epstein, Ruemmler didn't come from the upper middle classes. A profile of her <https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/8522-emerging-women-leaders-at-penn-law-nice-people> from 2018, says she arrived on her first day of law school without ever having a met a lawyer. Success comes from 'working hard, doing good work, and being a good person,' Ruemmler told students at Penn Carey Law School. "Don't be a jerk."

Eight years later, Ruemmler feels unfairly targeted as a result of her appearance in the Epstein files. “It is despicable to single out and attack a highly respected female professional simply because of her benign interactions with Jeffrey Epstein,” her spokesperson told the FT.  <https://www.ft.com/content/a07bb45d-512f-4694-9ce1-355b78131937>

Goldman Sachs staff seem more confused by the matter, though. Speaking to Bloomberg, some executives at the firm oserved that they would be fired for accepting gifts worth only a fraction of those Epstein gave Ruemmler before she joined. Their confusion is amplified by the fact that Ruemmler now oversees Goldman's compliance policies governing the receipt of such presents.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Ruemmler didn't respond to a request to comment.

Separately, the Times <https://www.thetimes.com/business/companies-markets/article/barclays-boss-ai-bot-cancer-venkat-qq6pnqldv> has been speaking to Coimbatore Sundararajan Venkatakrishnan (Venkat), the CEO of Barclays. 

Since his diagnosis  </news/2022/11/barclays-banker-cancer>with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2022, Venkat says he takes more care of himself. He now lies in until 5am and goes to bed at 10pm. “I used to be one of these people, you know, starting very early in the morning, staying very late, sort of running myself fully … [Now] I spend a little more time on my health and exercise and so on," he reveals.

            <description><![CDATA[Private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> had a good run, and people made a lot of money. Then things went sour – and private credit </news/2022/12/private-credit-jobs> had a good run. Now, with Q4 and 2025 results out this week for some of the world’s biggest private credit lenders, it seems that professionals hell-bent on private capital (or carried interest </news/what-is-carried-interest>) will need to find new employers. Again.

Ares, which published its results yesterday, was the biggest of the three firms to declare, with over $622bn in assets under management (AuM), of which $407bn was allocated to private credit. Times do not seem to be good for its employees. The firm’s compensation bill decreased by 32% from $2.6bn to $1.7bn.

Blue Owl Capital was the second biggest private credit firm to announce its results this week, with over $307bn in AuM, of which $158bn, or 51%, allocated to private credit. Its wage also fell, by 22%, from $1.3bn to $1.0bn.

Neither Ares nor Blue Owl disclosed how many people they employ.

Carlyle also announced results today. Although traditionally a private equity firm, its private credit offering is now a bigger slice of AuM: of the $477bn total assets, $211bn (around 44%) were in private credit, compared to $164bn (around 34%) in private equity. Interestingly, between 2024 and 2025, Carlyle’s private equity AuM were flat, while private credit AuM were up by 10%. Despite that, Carlyle's overall compensation bill was down by 18%.

For both Blue Owl and Ares, the largest increases in AuM between 2024 and 2025 were not in private equity or credit. Instead, it was their "real assets” allocation that rose by 63% and 85% respectively, a description that includes real estate and infrastructure </news/2022/07/how-to-get-a-job-in-an-infrastructure-fund>, including digital infrastructure such as data centers. 

The falling compensation bills come admidst the "SaaSpocalypse.” This has been promoted by fear that AI could massively harm software companies which received loans on the basis of huge, pre-AI valuations that might not exist in today’s world of ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude/Grok.

Shares in Blue Owl and Ares have fallen by 9% and 13% since Monday morning respectively as a result. That can't be nice for employees who have also been given deferred stock.

            <description><![CDATA[So, people at the FCA [UK Financial Conduct Authority] are complaining  </news/the-fca-had-another-awkward-townhall-about-returning-to-the-office>about returning to the office. I've worked for the FCA and I'm afraid that I have no sympathy at all.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

During my career I have never worked anywhere where people are as work-shy and wasteful as they are at the FCA. The behaviour there is appalling. There is absolutely no accountability and people spend much of their time trying to get away with the least amount of work possible. 

This means that jobs that should have taken six months can be strung out for two years or more. People choose to work at the FCA for an easy life and working from home has only made this worse. I had colleagues who would logon for an hour or two in the morning before doing for the rest of the day. People would leave calls to play sports or collect their children from school. The work ethic is awful.

This is why FCA staff absolutely need to be back in the office. Management are 100% right to ask them to go back in more often. They're not even asking for them to return every day, but only for 50% of the time and only from September. The complaints are laughable. 

I have no sympathy with my former colleagues whatsoever. Initially I felt sorry that their bonuses have been removed. However, they effectively had a pay rise when they worked from home by saving money on season tickets. If they're struggling now it's because they overspent! Very few of them even work eight hours a day!

            <description><![CDATA[Reporting season for America’s boutique investment banks </news/boutique-investment-banks> is in full swing. While PJT Partners did well </news/pjt-q4-2025> and kept pay steady, Perella Weinberg Partners had the opposite problem – it did badly, and pay consequently collapsed.

The problem started with the topline figures. Record high revenues in 2024 </news/perella-weinberg-partners-pay> declined by 14% in 2025, and dipped below even the first year of revenue post-IPO in 2021. In fact, if 2022 and 2023 wasn’t so bad for the market as a whole, it would have been PWP’s worst year ever as a public company. 

Consequently, pay at the firm cratered. PWP doesn’t disclose exact employee numbers, but it had “approximately 700” employees at the end of both 2024 and 2025. Its wage bill, however, declined by 32% between those two years. Average pay, assuming 700 employees, went from $1.1m to $765k, a decrease of some $350k - per person.

The actual decline might be even more significant than that. The firm noted that it added 12 new (expensive) partners and 11 new (also expensive) managing directors </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds> across 2025. It had 66 partners at the start of 2025, and 77 by the end. 31% of partners at the firm had been there for less than 3 years, up from 27%.

PWP might be taking a risk with its declining wage bill. Bloomberg noted <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/moelis-evercore-pay-costs-rise-at-least-23-in-talent-battle?taid=6984f859be49b700014b1d65&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_content=business&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter> yesterday that the talent war among boutique banks was pushing up the compensation bill of banks like Evercore and Moelis by 27% and 23%, respectively - even Lazard's </news/lazard-q4-2025> increased by 4%. PWP might be left behind.

Nonetheless, the bank was upbeat about the situation. The poor performance demonstrated “the strength and focus” of PWP apparently, and the firm was positive that its record investment in people would place it well for “broadly favorable conditions for M&A” in 2026. If only we could all be so positive.

Matt Halford, a partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in London, has reappeared at HSBC where he will be director of strategic revenue development for the corporate and institutional bank.

Writing on LinkedIn, Halford says this new role will entail him "shaping and delivering new solutions in partnership with clients." At BCG he says he was a "core member of the financial institutions practice."

HSBC is keen on hiring ex-consultants and is also keen on BCG, with which it has worked since at least 2017. Previously, HSBC hired McKinsey Partner Chirantan Barua </news/2021/06/hsbc-strategy-jobs> as head of strategy for the whole bank, but he is now CEO of Scottish Widows. 

BCG has long specialized in helping banks strip out layers and simplify their operations. Citi, for example, used its services to this end  </news/citi-bankers-may-be-interested-in-bcg-s-guide-to-the-best-banking-jobs-to-2027>in 2024. HSBC was also practicising simplification </news/hsbc-job-cuts-delayering-country-managers> before adopting the more ruthless approach  </news/hsbc-s-self-proclaimed-ruthless-ceo-is-not-its-most-feared-person>of closing much of its M&A and ECM businesses last year. </news/hscb-closure-europe-us-job-cuts>

Now it seems that Halford might help the bank diversify a bit again.

            <description><![CDATA[If, aged 29, you were to marry a 34 year-old woman whose family had made nearly $1bn in Malaysia after the second world war, and who was in a position to buy a house worth over $20m in London's Primrose Hill, would you continue getting up at 5.30am and going to work as a rates trader at Morgan Stanley or Credit Suisse?

In the case of Durham University graduate Ardal Loh-Granger, the answer was no. Having worked his way through a Goldman Sachs </news/how-to-get-a-job-goldman-sachs> internship </news/internship-investment-bank>, three years at Morgan Stanley and two years at Credit Suisse, Loh Granger gave up working in 2018 to oversee renovations of the marital home and support his wife.

That may have been a mistake. While the "enormous" trust fund of his wife Wei-Lyn Loh may have seemed sufficient to sustain Granger into his dotage, he made the error of having an affair. Aged 35, he no longer has access to his wife's money cushion and has received a payout of only £2.4m  <https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ex-goldman-sachs-banker-who-36668882>($3.3m) instead of the £6.5m he was hoping for. Granger's wife had a prenup and the judge ruled that he'd spent the other £4m during the latter stages of his marriage.

£2.4m is enough to live well if you're judicious with your investments. However, Granger, seems used to having staff and receiving £200k cars as gifts It's possible to navigate these relationships while remaining employed - ask ex-Goldman Sachs banker Rishi Sunak </news/2022/10/rishi-sunak-goldman-sachs>. If anyone wants a macro trader with home renovation experience, Granger may soon be back on the market. 

Separately, someone who seems less likely to suffer marital infirmity is Minal Bathwal a 44 year-old trader at Brevan Howard in Singapore. Bathwal says the“first true test” of a good trader is ensuring that a spouse can't tell whether you had a good or bad day when you get home from work. “Be passionate about work, not emotional,” is his epithet.

In this way, Bathwal - who's described by Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-06/hedge-fund-trader-minal-bathwal-makes-billions-at-brevan-howard-in-singapore?utm_medium=email&utm_source=author_alert&utm_term=260206&utm_campaign=author_19458291> as "philosophical" and manages $5.5bn - has had no down years since 2008.

            <description><![CDATA[Brad Karp, chairman of elite law firm Paul Weiss, did not seem pleased about resigning from his role yesterday. In a statement provided to Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/-call-brad-karp-epstein-s-fondness-for-lawyer-ends-in-downfall>, he said: “Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed a focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.” When the furore erupted, the Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/leader-of-paul-weiss-resigns-over-epstein-ties-940031fc?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqeQp4GEeUIUUvwsRp2a0KBjgYUyFGtM3J4ApRFxYKzAzBNs4sAV2PWdWLJuHjk%3D&gaa_ts=6984d1cb&gaa_sig=typIInvKWre-VXqvawWAw7CH98nVQx4b9ZSdowE-kzXzgiOxKSgxlZ0yqC0PjUbHbqdmRADZjmAWLqWYcw1vyA%3D%3D> says Karp was scheduled to speak at an event on 'leadership in uncertain times'; he dropped out.

Jeffrey Epstein has derailed Karp. Emails <https://www.ft.com/content/e12add1a-56ab-41b9-8288-f8df81ab57f1> released by the Department of Justice in the Epstein files suggested that Karp and Epstein were friends. Karp asked Epstein to help his son find work with Woody Allen. Karp attended a dinner with Epstein in 2015, which he subsequently described as "truly "once in a lifetime" in every way." And that Karp volunteered to review a letter relating to Epstein's 2008 prosecution agreement. <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/01/usa> In turn, Epstein emailed Karp promising, “There are many many nights of unique talents. you will be invited often.” 

Paul Weiss did not respond to requests to comment for this article. There is no indication that either Karp or Paul Weiss ever represented Jeffrey Epstein. Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the firm told Reuters  <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/paul-weiss-chair-karp-regrets-epstein-interactions-firm-says-2026-02-03/>that Karp did nothing wrong: “Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.” 

Today, the Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/a-revolt-inside-paul-weiss-over-the-epstein-files-took-down-brad-karp-955fdfe6?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqd8UMnXuVQmPZM8DHOQKYeNjNTbLgH0QX5qJvNZNcDNFt9wKfhyE1Pdjd-76wE%3D&gaa_ts=6984e1e2&gaa_sig=46wwvkShzspxdASKkqbRTr0GVjozPKzWFkm8bXU3ngSypgDjAgO53_qQ0pb5qboRYx86C7M3P8owcphxKHWgSg%3D%3D> is reporting that Karp was ousted from the top job at Paul Weiss on Wednesday by a group of partners who met without him and decided the Epstein reports were simply too distracting. Karp was reportedly surprised, but went quietly for the good of the firm he'd helped build over 20 years.

Karp's demotion marks the end of an era on Wall Street, where he was a popular figure working on behalf of banks. In an interview last year, Karp told the Vault  <https://www.paulweiss.com/media/wvvfa5bn/vault_a_litigation_trailblazer.pdf>that his clients included Citigroup, TD, UBS, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Apollo, Blackstone, and KKR. 

Among other things, Karp told the Vault that he worked with clients on "sensitive internal investigations," "complex crises," and "damaging media coverage."

His cases included discrimination and sexual harassment cases. As a junior, Karp worked worked on the infamous Boom Boom Room case, which began in 1997 with allegations about sexual harassment and discrimination in a Smith Barney Branch, and which ended with a $33m gender bias class action settlement by Citi <https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us/citigroup-confirms-33-mln-gender-bias-settlement-idUSN03481416/> in 2008. 

Karp reportedly  <https://www.superlawyers.com/articles/new-york/the-team-player/>helped Citi sift through 2,000 claims as part of that settlement process. Afterwards, he praised Citi for wanting "do justice by the plaintiffs."

Since then, Citi has used Paul Weiss to work on other allegations against the bank by its staff. In a post on LinkedIn, Ardith Lindsey,  </news/citi-equities-insiders-on-the-real-problem-london-management-poor-promotions>the Citi managing director pursuing a sexual assault and harassment case, claims that Paul Weiss attorneys are representing Citi against her. Citi also recently used Paul Weiss's people to interview its women complaining of mistreatment by its allegedly angry wealth head </news/andy-sieg-investigation>. Some of those women subsequently complained that they had not been interviewed after all. 

Citi has repeatedly refuted all claims of wrongdoing relating to its head of wealth management and is fighting Lindsey's claim. The bank declined to comment for this article. Karp may still be on hand to help: the WSJ says he will remain at Paul Weiss as a partner and will continue to work for his clients.

            <title>The FCA had another awkward townhall about returning to the office</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/the-fca-had-another-awkward-townhall-about-returning-to-the-office</link>
            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/YdHJRo79QCak6wvWgQzj" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[As we reported here </news/fca-back-to-the-office> and here  </news/fca-return-to-office>earlier this month, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants its people to return to the office for at least 50% of the time from September 2026 (60% for executive directors). The FCA's people are, however, used to working from home for 60% of their time and do not want to come back.

Today we understand that senior management at the FCA ran another townhall trying to persuade recalcitrant employees that it has everyone's best interests at heart. 

Insiders say that the townhall did not go well and claim that the internal message board was instead deluged with comments like those we have extracted below. The survey referred to is an internal FCA survey on remote work, which we understand unearthed overwhelming employee support for home working.


"In light of the recent hybrid working announcement, which is expected to increase costs for employees, combined with the current low pay offer, are there any plans to provide additional support to staff in managing these increased financial pressures?"
"Many staff will not be getting a pay rise in line with inflation, and given office attendance will be rising by 25%, why are staff being rewarded for an excellent year with a real-terms pay cut?"
"Can you explain why the maximum level for each pay range (except Directors) has not increased this year? The consequence is that pay ranges have been narrowed, pushing more people to the high end of the range or onto maintained pay."


"What benefits of attending the office at 50% cannot be achieved at 40%?"

"When you mention there being “very mixed views”, are you referring to staff views, given the staff survey found the overwhelming majority wanted to keep office time the same or reduce it?"


"Conceptually, a month has around 20 business days. At 50%, this equates to 10 days per month or 30 days over three months. However, not all months have the same number of business days. If there are 61 business days in a three-month period and someone attends 30 days (49.12%), are they required to attend an extra day to reach 50%?"
 "Did senior leadership consider graduating required office attendance by grade (for example, lower grades at 40%, managers at 50%, senior leadership at 60%) to reflect commuting costs relative to salary? If so, why was this approach discounted?"
"As a data-led organisation, why was the data provided by the CRF report ignored in favour of non-forensic “senior leadership judgement” when making the hybrid working decision?"


The complaints are unlikely to make much difference. A spokesperson for the FCA said she was disappointed that they have been made public . She added that: “We recognise that there is a range of views amongst colleagues on the increase to office attendance and many are understandably concerned about the impact on them. Our leadership team are engaging with colleagues on these concerns, including an hour’s Townhall today."

            <description><![CDATA[UBS has got a lot more bankers than before. It also has more revenues. This year it wants growth again, and it should not be difficult to achieve that.

When the Swiss bank announced its fourth quarter results this week </news/ubs-will-be-cutting-another-1-1bn-from-employment-costs-this-year>, it reiterated its target of doubling its global banking revenues by the end of 2026 relative to 2022.

UBS aspirations are based on global banking revenues adjusted for 'Purchase Price Allocation', or the fair value of assets that came with Credit Suisse. On this basis, UBS's new bankers need to grow revenues by 16.3% this year if they're to meet the stated target.

This should be feasible and it might even be easy. As the chart above shows, UBS's bankers managed to increase revenues by 35% between 2023 and 2024, despite only managing 10% growth last year. Speaking on the bank's fourth quarter call, CFO Todd Tuckner said last year's feeble performance was the result of weakness in the equity capital markets (ECM) business in the first quarters. This is changing. In the fourth quarter, UBS's ECM revenues were up 68%.

UBS has no shortage of bankers to drive its 2026 growth. Speaking to Financial News  <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/ubss-marco-valla-eyes-us-growth-senior-hires-and-big-m-a-deals-in-top-six-push-4c240eb3>in December, co-president of the investment bank Marco Valla said the bank hired 25 "senior dealmakers" globally last year, alongside the 100 it acquired earlier from Credit Suisse. 

This year, those bankers need to an additional $444m of revenues to hit the target. Split between 125 people that's just $3.5m each. Given that people like Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick are "amped" <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/morgan-stanley-s-pick-pretty-amped-up-about-the-m-a-landscape> about the year to come, UBS could probably be more ambitious.

            <description><![CDATA[Big Tech firms have been laying off engineers en masse to start 2026, and cloud </news/deutsche-bank-cloud-transformation-costs> staff are up for the axe. AWS staff were affected by Amazon's 16,000 layoffs <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2ywzxlxnlo> in January, while there are unconfirmed reports that cloud infrastructure firm Oracle could lay off up to 30,000 people. <https://www.cio.com/article/4125103/oracle-may-slash-up-to-30000-jobs-to-fund-ai-data-center-expansion-as-us-banks-retreat.html> Is the future of banking cloud jobs just as grim?

Follow eFinancialCareers on Google News here. <https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV1ZtYVc1aGJtTnBZV3hqWVhKbFpYSnpMbU52YlNnQVAB?ceid=GB:en&oc=3> 

Cloud engineers </news/how-to-get-a-technology-job-bank> we've spoken to anonymously have mixed emotions. One former cloud engineer at a top US bank in New York told us there are "fears over job security" among cloud engineers and that job interviews are now few and far between. "There seems to be no traction from submitting applications," he said.

Another Cloud engineer at a US bank said "there has certainly been a downtick" in cloud hiring, but it hasn't disappeared entirely. He gets 20-30 emails per day and a few calls from recruiters, but this is "down from a peak during covid of a call every ~15 minutes and 150 emails per day."

Banks still have plenty of open job listings for cloud engineers. We've analyzed data for 14 major banks to see how many engineers are working directly on cloud infrastructure. There are over 1,300 jobs globally, including over 400 in the US. HSBC, Citi, BofA and JPMorgan each have over 100 cloud engineer listings, but the likes of BNP Paribas and UBS are hiring in much smaller numbers.

Cloud engineers were in vogue </news/2022/06/cloud-engineering-jobs-banking> as banks begun their transformation efforts, dismantling legacy technology and bringing everything together on the cloud. Cloud engineering job security becomes more tentative </news/barclays-tech-overhaul-good-for-uk-technologists-less-so-for-cloud-staff> as these transformations near completion, but maintaining AI </news/bankers-frustrated-with-ai-liken-their-jobs-to-manual-labour> architecture may have given them a lifeline. The second cloud engineer said "we're finding it still takes a lot of time to do work even with latest models at our side... I'm seeing an uptick in emails again."

Top cloud engineers may be more valued in other financial firms, however. The New York engineer said he'd been invited to just one interview at a bank in the past six months, but had received "maybe four invitations to interview with hedge funds." These roles are often more than just cloud engineering, though; Citadel's site reliability engineering (SRE) team work on cloud architecture, Linux systems engineering, incident response and more.

However, it was comparable to American banks Bank of America and Goldman Sachs (up by 8% and 9%, respectively). BNP Paribas seemed nonetheless content with the increase, which it credited “mainly” to “rates and options activities.”

Sadly the French bank's equities & prime services team did even worse. Revenue here was up just 10% in 2025 on 2024, well behind what any of the other major banks have posted. Fortunately, the bank was even happier with the increase, which was “across all segments and regions.”

BNP doesn’t break down investment banking revenue, but it did note that it had a “good increase” in both capital markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> and advisory, mostly on account of a strong performance in the Americas – which was the best-performing region globally anyway in M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs>, according to LSEG, formerly Refinitiv.

As such, bonuses will likely be scant. Across 2025 as a whole, the investment bank’s operating expenses increased by just 3%, from €10.7bn to €11.0bn. In Q4 alone, expenses declined ever so slightly. 

Perhaps more worryingly, the investment bank’s risk weighted assets (RWA) declined from €278bn to €258bn, a decrease of more than 7%. How RWA is calculated is complicated, but just for reference, consumer & personal banking RWA declined by just 1%, and investment & protection services RWA increased by 33%.

            <description><![CDATA[Investment banks don't just hire investment bankers for their internship </news/internship-investment-bank> and graduate </news/bank-acceptance-rate> roles. If you study maths </news/best-degree-for-hedge-fund-job>, computer science </news/unemployment-uk-graduates> or another STEM subject, you could get a technology role in a bank, </news/how-to-get-a-technology-job-bank> but which universities do banks love the most for these roles?

Follow eFinancialCareers on Google News here. <https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV1ZtYVc1aGJtTnBZV3hqWVhKbFpYSnpMbU52YlNnQVAB?ceid=GB:en&oc=3> 

We've analysed data from our CV database and publicly available information on LinkedIn for 16 major UK universities to provide a proprietary score for getting a banking technology job, looking at total alumni working in banking as well as intern/graduate level professionals. 

The results are clear. Imperial College is your best option, with next to no competition; it ranked first in every metric analysed and had almost triple the score of the second-best university, Warwick.

Many of the top technologists in banking worldwide have studied at Imperial.  David Coulson, a Goldman Sachs partner and CTO of banking and markets, studied a PhD in theoretical physics at Imperial while Citi's chief technology officer, David Griffiths </news/citi-s-cto-says-these-are-the-kinds-of-jobs-he-s-eliminating-with-ai>, has a computer science masters from the university. Citi's chief information officer, Jonathan Lofthouse, </news/citi-hybrid-working-cio> studied at second-ranked Warwick.

Imperial ranks 22nd in the world for computer science in the QS university rankings <https://www.topuniversities.com/university-subject-rankings/computer-science-information-systems>, and third in the UK behind Oxford and Cambridge. Oxbridge graduates are less numerous in banking tech but are still present. They are favourites, for example, of electronic trading firms like Jane Street </news/the-20-universities-jane-street-loves-most-for-its-quants-and-engineers> and Citadel Securities </news/the-universities-that-will-get-you-a-300k-job-at-citadel-securities>, which tend to pay their tech staff much more money and poach a lot of the top talent. Other top-ranked universities are typical broad banking target schools, </news/target-universities-finance-uk> including LSE and UCL in London.

Getting a graduate technology job in banking isn't just about what school you attend. To get in, you'll need to brush up on Leetcode </news/how-much-leetcode-should-you-do-to-work-at-google-or-goldman-sachs> problems to pass banking technology assessments, and you'll probably need to have multiple personal projects or open-source contributions </news/hedge-fund-tech-cv-interview-advice#:~:text=Another%20way%20you,your%20own%20risk.> to stand out.

            <description><![CDATA[When HSBC announced its bonuses last year, some people had a shock. Not only were they receiving zero bonuses, they were losing their jobs. In the words of CEO Georges Elhedery, the bank had decided to be ruthless.  </news/hsbc-s-self-proclaimed-ruthless-ceo-is-not-its-most-feared-person>

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

"We were split into three categories," one HSBC insider told us at the time. </news/hsbc-zero-bonuses-fired> "a) Fired today (no bonus, here is your severance package); b; Short term retention (finish your project and then likely severance and small bonus); c). Long term retention." It was a surprise: "HSBC had a reputation for looking after [its] people,” another employee reflected. Recent reports suggest that 25% of managing directors </news/hsbc-michael-roberts> were let go. 

Now it seems that HSBC is doubling down on its new reputation for ruthlessness. Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/hsbc-to-cull-underperformers-as-some-bankers-face-zero-bonuses> reports that the bank is preparing to pay some people zero bonuses for 2025 as it moves to a Jefferies-style </news/jefferies-bonuses> 'eat what you kill' mentality, albeit without Jefferies' cash. MDs will be included in this new bonus approach, which is presumably being overseen by ex-Citi corporate banker Michael Roberts, head of the corporate and institutional bank, and his close colleague Gerry Keefe. 

Eating what you kill is a fine aspiration, but it is not necessarily as clean cut as chasing and eating a horned beast. Banks are notoriously political places and if a beast is about to be killed, all the big cats will gather round and claim their part in taking it down. Evercore, for example, operates an eat what you kill  </news/barclays-cost-cutting>approach to bonuses, and when its MDs submit numbers for deals they've each originated, those numbers reportedly <https://www.ft.com/content/51c51a6d-4727-413c-98f9-458afdf51ed0> always exceed the total. 

Things could be particularly brutal at HSBC, where the corporate and institutional bank were combined in 2024. There are now corporate bankers, investment bankers, sector teams, product teams </news/hsbc-cuts> and the remaining M&A execution team all vying to claim that they made the kill.

Jefferies is supposed to be </news/it-s-bonus-week-at-jefferies-i-am-told-it-has-been-a-great-year> moving away from this model in an attempt to become more collusive. HSBC reportedly wants its zeroed bankers to leave. Unhappy people could always try there instead.

            <description><![CDATA[When should you leave your steady banking job, with its steady salary and its wealth of deferred bonuses? It's always a hard decision, particularly if you're a managing director who's worked at one bank for 20 years and your deferred is large.

Paul Barrett seems to have thought hard before leaving JPMorgan. After the event, Barrett wrote to his new employer and complained: “I walked away from all my JPM stock and now my annual compensation is reduced by 66% until I can sign more clients." Fortunately, he still seems to been in receipt of a $30k monthly management fee.

Barrett's travails are detailed in the Financial Times. <https://www.ft.com/content/649886ce-877e-4aac-80d5-57e1d6422028?accessToken=zwAAAZwpnrnakc9kmIbOh35KrNOA1Vfh1kIgKA.MEYCIQD1PmaNAuxA8cvQHfW6ONTyWrV7Ikk8cZ6IyH7t2RD3fAIhANvYhSSoKfZ69fj5xFJWzLDPKrUO3dtDdw60tiGvWVkT&segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&shareType=enterprise&shareId=8101f34a-f58f-4eb7-8405-18559b8065ad> Like many bankers, he left the carpeted corridors of the big institution for the thrill of the family office </news/family-office-jobs>. Unfortunately, the family he chose was the one-man-dynasty of Jeffrey Epstein. 

It was a fatal move. Along with Peter Mandelson </news/peter-mandelson-deutsche-bank>, Jes Staley </news/jes-staley-bill-winters-jpmorgan> and many others, Barrett's subsequent career implosion is now public knowledge. As Jeffrey's private banker, he suffered all the standard problems of private office persons (can't always get hold of the founder, founder has own opinions about investments, founder loses confidence after a period of poor returns), plus the fact that his name became associated with the world's most notorious deceased sex offender.

It can't have been easy for Barrett, described by ex-colleagues to the FT as "sophisticated, intelligent" and "with a certain air of confidence." Fortunately, though, he was able to take himself off to Citi. After seemingly minimal due diligence, the bank hired Barrett in 2019 and appointed him to head its private capital group's North American region.  <https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-private-bank-aiming-to-grow-junior-talent-by-20-2019-11>Barrett left again five years later once Citi apprehended his history. It's not clear whether he got to keep any stock that time instead.

Separately, young people love venture capital firms, but venture capital firms do not love young people.

Three years ago, VC jobs were all the rage  </news/2023/01/venture-capitalism-jobs>with 26 year-olds aspiring to find the next unicorn. Now, a new compensation survey says their pay is shrivelling.

While senior VCs are still handsomely remunerated, newcomer <https://www.newcomer.co/p/heres-what-your-fellow-venture-capitalists?utm_source=substack&publication_id=82416&post_id=186864407&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share> notes that analyst salaries fell 25% last year to $78k and that few analysts in VC firms receive carried interest </news/what-is-carried-interest>, even when it is available.

AI is to blame. Large language models are proficient at market mapping, deal sourcing and competitive research and you don't have to pay them much at all.

This year, he seems to have left Jain Global.

We have not spoken to Filho and Jain Global didn't respond to a request to comment. The FCA Register says Filho left Jain on February 2nd. Headhunters confirmed this.

It's not clear where he's going next. Filho is a popular figure in the market who was well liked at Morgan Stanley.

Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/jain-hedge-fund-costs-cut-into-750-million-profits-last-year>reported that Jain Global made $750m in trading profits last year. Bloomberg also said that much of that went to paying the front loaded expenses of its 50 trading teams.

            <description><![CDATA[If you're looking for a job with a $1m salary and a $4m-$10m bonus with Deutsche Bank in London, then the recently released Epstein Files <https://www.justice.gov/epstein> offer some helpful pointers on how this might be achieved.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

As has been noted, Peter Mandelson </news/jes-staley-bill-winters-jpmorgan>, the now disgraced ex-member of the Labour Party, ex-member of the House of Lords and ex-US ambassador, sent some emails to Jeffrey Epstein regarding a job at Deutsche Bank. These we have published below. They are also visible here. <https://taxpolicy.org.uk/2026/02/02/mandelson-epstein-no10-documents-4m-job/>

Mandelson's emails suggested that he received an offer to work for Deutsche Bank "on an international basis" in 2010. He claims that he was to be paid up to $4m for his services, but the first email in the chain below suggests he could have earned $11m at the most.

It seems that Mandelson never took the job. Deutsche Bank isn't commenting, but it's understood that Mandelson has never worked for the German bank. Nonetheless, Mandelson's email exchange suggests broad tactics that jobseekers may want to bear in mind.


Know a major networker. Mandelson knew Epstein. Epstein was also best chums with Disney fan and ex-Barclays CEO Jes Staley </news/jes-staley-bill-winters-jpmorgan>. We are not advocating that anyone befriend a paedophile, but Mandelson's emails with Epstein confirm that knowing people who know people unfortunately makes all the difference.
Use an intermediary. One 'Martin Armstrong' spoke to Colin Grassie, Deutsche Bank's then CEO of the UK on Mandelson's behalf. There are Martin Armstrongs who fit this potential profile on Google. We asked one of them to comment; he declined.
Be keen. Accept all job offers promptly 
Use one offer to get another. Having accepted the offer from Deutsche Bank, Mandelson tried to get a better offer from Kleinwort's from someone called Tim Collins, who had big opinions about Deutsche's strategy.
Do not disclose your different offers. Epstein told Mandelson not to tell Tim about his Deutsche Bank discussions.


Ultimately, it seems that Mandelson took neither job. It is not clear why.

On February 12th, Clear Street is reportedly  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/wall-street-broker-clear-street-seeks-1-05-billion-in-ipo?taid=6983479eba85ed00014b86ab&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_content=business&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter>proposing to sell 23.8bn shares for between $40 and $44 each. Today's filing reveals that 7.8 million restricted stock units were issued to employees in 2023 and 2024 respectively, at prices ranging between $5.5 and $7.4. In 2022 and 2023, employees were also given 3.7m and 5.8m of stock options at prices below $2 and $3.

Some people at Clear Street are therefore about to become very rich. The people cut last year are probably not among them.

Instead, Clear Street's coming IPO is likely to reward its senior executives and its top technology staff. That includes brothers in law and executive chairman and executive vice chairman, Uriel Cohen and Elli Ausubel. CEO Edward Tilly, who was in retirement before he joined from CBoe markets in 2024 has $71m in unvested stock.

Clear Street said today that 40% of its employees are engineers and that another 7.5% of them work in risk and control functions. It added that it's hired more than 200 engineers since 2023 and that paying them well is necessary because, "competition in the technology industry for qualified employees is intense and many of these employees hold extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas spanning technology and capital markets, including the options, equities and futures trading and clearing industry."

Technology staff in banks, who are complaining of reduced bonuses this year, may find this energising.

            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/LMFkmOAvRqinoJ3Q5VcQ" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[Andrea Orcel </news/andrea-orcel-unicredit-commerzbank>, the workaholic investment banker with a penchant for calling people at 5am </news/2012/03/what-ubss-investment-bankers-need-to-know-about-andrea-orcel#:~:text=2.%20He%20will%20be%20calling%20you%20at%205am>, became CEO of Italian bank UniCredit in 2021. Since then, the bank's stock price has increased by almost 10 times. This didn't come without sacrifice.

Follow eFinancialCareers on Google News here. <https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV1ZtYVc1aGJtTnBZV3hqWVhKbFpYSnpMbU52YlNnQVAB?ceid=GB:en&oc=3> 

Speaking on a podcast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUCIBWBo1b4> with Norges Bank this week, Orcel said that "culture is the lynchpin of everything" and a good culture is a guarantee of eventual success. He also said that, "inevitably, to change it, you have to purge people who are not in that culture." Making cuts was one of the earliest things he did after assuming the role, including removing a co-head structure, <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/unicredits-new-ceo-orcel-streamlines-top-management-structure-2021-05-12/> much like Citi has (kind of </news/citi-has-a-lot-of-new-co-heads-for-a-bank-that-doesn-t-like-them>) been doing in recent years.

In the podcast, Orcel said that there were 80,000 people when he joined, but there are 69,000 today, implying that at least 11,000 have been purged. How did he decide who didn't make the cut?

Orcel said that one of his earliest tasks was "interviewing, directly or indirectly, 20,000-30,000 people" to find out their values and what "made them tick." He figured out the cultural "pillars" of the company from these responses (integrity, ownership and care, apparently) and built the company's strategy around them. People lacking those attributes have presumably been ejected.

Orcel also said he initially used a top-down management style to instil values, but that the culture is now bottom-up instead. He doesn't mandate that people come to the office </news/days-in-the-office-by-bank> at specific times. However, people at UniCredit work similarly long hours: "because I work really hard, I drag them."

UniCredit is attempting to hold onto its best people even in fields susceptible to AI </news/jpmorgan-ai-jobs> and automation. Orcel said that, a year after he joined, the bank created a "risk healing unit" to reskill high-quality people in disintermediated jobs. 650-700 people have gone through the unit so far.

While Orcel's purging seems to have benefitted the share price, he has reportedly faced criticism from UniCredit's board for the performance of its investment bank. Reuters <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/unicredit-ceo-under-renewed-board-pressure-over-ma-clarity-sources-say-2025-10-22/> reported in October that the bank had not landed any major deals despite large investments. Orcel said that a full cultural transformation for a company the size of UniCredit can take more than a decade; perhaps more purging is necessary.

PJT yesterday </news/pjt-q4-2025> did great, and Evercore today <https://investors.evercore.com/news-releases/news-release-details/evercore-reports-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025> did even better – and was more generous with the purse strings.

Net revenue and income at the firm shot up by 29% and 53% to $3.8bn and $641m respectively, which founder and chairman Roger Altman noted was a record. The firm’s market share was also at an all-time high.

The firm also added people last year. Headcount went from 2,380 at the start of 2025 to 2,570 by the end of the year, an 8% increase. And average pay also went up by 17%, from an already impressive $829k across 2024 to an eye-watering $973k across 2025.

That increase was partly related to who joined the bank. The number of senior managing directors (equivalent to MDs at a normal bank or Partners at other boutiques) in investment banking & equities went from 184 to 210, a 14% increase.

Although the bank itself admitted that the “senior new hires” helped to pump up the wage bill in Q4, it wasn’t the only reason. Accrual of “incentive compensation”, that is to say bonuses </news/banker-bonuses>, and “higher base salaries” also contributed to the increase across Q4 and the year as a whole. Evercore’s bankers will be eating well this bonus season.

I've held senior roles at leading banks and have worked for multistrategy hedge funds. </news/big-multistrategy-hedge-funds> I have also interviewed a lot of students who want to be traders.

In doing so, I have noticed that they repeatedly make the same mistakes. Once a student makes it through the HR interview and is actually talking to the desk, they will almost always start talking about all the risk they've taken in their own investments.

I often encounter students who tell me about their multi-hundred % returns and their crypto wins. They seem to think that this is what I am looking for. 

They are wrong.

I don't want to hire people who take a lot of risk. I want to hire people who are prudent, with a selective risk appetite and sensible targets. 

I am interested in people willing to run a marathon, not sprint heroically in search of quick profits. 

Students don't seem to understand this.

When young people in interviews </news/70-top-banking-interview-questions-and-how-to-answer-them> say they make 20-50-100% returns, it's a red flag. Most of the instruments we trade move by 1-2% intraday.

Our worry, therefore, is that young people accustomed to crypto volatility will struggle on an institutional trading desk. Their sizing adjustment will be too much of an expensive lesson to learn. 

What we are looking for is not people with big crypto wins. We want people with completely psychological and emotional control, who can take large notionals of risk with very prudent and tight management. 

Please remember this next time you boast of your 400% bitcoin returns.

In its own words, the bank is busy "executing final stages of integration to capture synergies." The integration of Credit Suisse is nearly over.

It is not, however, over completely.

Although 73% of applications have been decommissioned, although the 'CS legacy IT infrastructure wind-down and legal entities integration' is "materially complete", although $13bn has already been spent integrating Credit Suisse and even $10.7bn of cost savings have been squeezed, there are more costs to come out this year.

UBS said today that it intends to extract a further $2.8bn from costs in 2026. 40% of this is to come from people: $1.1bn will be removed from the compensation line across the bank. Heads will roll.

Who will go? 

Maybe not the investment bankers, who are tasked with doubling revenues from the 2022 level by the end of 2025. Last year, UBS's M&A revenues were 10.5% while capital markets revenues fell by 7%. This year, CEO Sergio Ermotti said he's hopeful that IPOs will drive stronger revenues in ECM.

Maybe not UBS's equities sales and trading professionals, who achieved a "record share" in cash equities and a strong performance in prime and equity derivatives.

Maybe not the bank's FX or precious metals traders, who it says had a strong 2025. Nor the bank's rates traders </news/ubs-markets-bonuses>, who already look a little diminished. 

Maybe not the technology team working on the integration. Although most has been done, Ermotti said today that the final stretch will be the hardest to achieve.

Within the investment bank at least, then, it might be mostly middle and back office </news/finance/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking> people who suffer. The bank has the standard "portfolio of large scale AI programs" which are intended to "unlock" efficiencies and cost savings. The key is turning on process-oriented jobs.

            <description><![CDATA[The two great noble houses of investment banking, alike in dignity, are “Sales and Trading”  </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank>and “Capital Markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> and Advisory </news/get-a-job-in-ma>”.  And relations between the two are often rather like the Montagues and Capulets; they’re two indispensable parts of the same show, but that doesn’t mean that they have much in common.  Usually this is reflected in co-head structures; when you have joint leadership of a regional business unit, one co-head represents markets and one represents bankers.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Conor Hillery and Matthieu Wiltz </news/jp-morgan-s-new-london-leaders-are-possibly-more-popular-than-its-old-ones> are this star-crossed pair at JPMorgan. The two men were appointed co-CEOs of global banking in EMEA late last year, and have since been making a point about how well they get on </news/jpmorgan-bonus-cap>. Wiltz has a background in credit sales and runs JPMorgan's EMEA markets business. Hillery is a financial institutions group (FIG) banker by trade and runs JPMorgan's European investment banking business.

However, things are changing with their most recent promotion <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/jpmorgan-hands-hillery-and-wiltz-top-global-banking-roles-in-europe-d0e5d417>. Wiltz is being asked to cross the divide.

While Wiltz remains head of EMEA sales and global head of credit, securitised products and public finance sales, he is also going to be given “dealmaking” responsibilities. Hillery keeps his role as EMEA head of investment banking.

It’s not completely clear what deals Matthieu Wiltz is going to be doing, but we might speculate that it’s related to management’s decision to increase the pressure </news/jpmorgan-bankers-pressure-2026> on JPMorgan bankers to ask for more business <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/jpmorgans-new-emea-ceos-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-for-more-business-76091792> and win back market share.  Among the core skills of any head of sales and trading is the ability to put pressure on people.

It might backfire.  The culture of investment banking is different to the trading floor; M&A and capital markets deals intrinsically take longer to put together than bond trades.  There is a fine line between hustle and hassle; it’s good to promote aggression and proactivity, but not if it starts to undermine long term relationships for the sake of quick transactional wins.  Filippo Gori, the previous JP Morgan EMEA CEO once warned <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/an-audience-with-jpmorgans-filippo-gori-were-looking-at-things-that-havent-been-touched-for-20-years-02544e3f> that the switch from trading to banking was “a big cultural shock”.

Elsewhere, it's not easy to be a hedge fund founder facing an investigation by the board, which appears to have unearthed dozens <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/odey-investigators-uncovered-46-conduct-allegations-against-him-fca-says> of misconduct allegations. What do you do?

If you’re Crispin Odey, it seems that you tolerate it once, agreeing to a final written warning from the executive committee of Odey Asset Management.  But if they begin a second investigation, following further complaints, your patience wanes.  

A new filing by the Financial Conduct Authority, which is in a legal battle with Odey over its decision to ban him from financial services (which he disagrees with), suggest Odey didn't take kindly to being investigated. 

After berating the board as “spineless” and telling them that “HR law doesn’t apply here”, the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/73b1c8b7-792e-4d36-8d1a-371d71710443> notes that the filing claims that Odey used his majority shareholding to dismiss the entire committee, appoint himself the only member and then vote to suspend the investigation into himself indefinitely.

Odey “strenuously denies all the allegations” (in this case, five personal injury claims brought against him by former employees and a libel claim against the FT).  But it really feels like, whatever comes out in court, this is definitely an episode where a calmer temper and a bit of common sense could have saved a lot of trouble.

Meanwhile ...

Ken Griffin has admitted that CEOs find it “incredibly distasteful” to have to “suck up” to the White House in order to keep running their business.  This might seem inconsistent with past statements the Citadel founder has made about President Trump, but it’s entirely in line with the pod shop model – if you lose a couple of per cent support in the opinion polls, you get your allocation cut. (WSJ <https://www.wsj.com/business/ken-griffin-says-ceos-find-trumps-interference-distasteful-3c388e8f>)

At the age of 71, Howard Silverblatt of S&P Global has decided that “that sixty hour workweek is not as much fun as it used to be”, even if you can spend  it working from home in Florida.  He is retiring, and now lots of investors are panicking about how they might replace the “pope of earnings”. (WSJ <https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/howard-silverblatt-sp-global-retirement-ccbb929d>)

Never previously someone who has shown a huge amount of concern for his reputation, Lars Windhorst demonstrates that even his thick skin is not impenetrable; he’s been moved to strenous denials of any involvement with Jeffrey Epstein after an email showed up which appeared to suggest he’d been asking for a meeting. (Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/lars-windhorst-denies-link-to-jeffrey-epstein-as-email-claims-he-sought-meeting-1f519a06>)

The strain of working in finance can often break up marriages, but something weirder might have happened here.  A senior official at the FDA is being accused of having concocted a “sham divorce” so that his venture capitalist wife wouldn’t have to divest some of her investments. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/senior-fda-official-under-oig-investigation-over-divorce-assets?embedded-checkout=true>)

The past is never dead in Swiss banking – it often isn’t even past.  UBS is still dealing with further investigations into it (and Credit Suisse’s) actions with respect to the bank accounts of fugitives from the Nazis. (WSJ <https://www.wsj.com/finance/hundreds-of-swiss-bank-accounts-with-suspected-nazi-links-found-by-investigators-cda06807>)

Jason Ader was once a prominent activist investor, claiming CEO scalps like that of Marisa Meyer at Yahoo. He is now in court, being sued by his own mother over a defaulted mortgage and begging the judge not to “take the shirt from his back”.  The good days are over. (NY Post <https://nypost.com/2026/02/02/business/deadbeat-hedge-fund-boss-sued-by-his-own-mother-declares-bankruptcy/>)

            <description><![CDATA[2025 was a big year for US bank hiring. It was also a big year for US bank exits.

A new report says top US banks doubled their managing director (MD) hiring last year. This might discourage hiring in 2026, but for the fact many existing MDs also moved on.

The chart above is based on data from search firm Sheffield Haworth. It has not been validated by the banks concerned. 

Sheffield Haworth estimates that Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, RBC and UBS each either doubled or more than doubled their hiring of external investment banking MDs in 2025 versus 2024. JPMorgan, Citi and Barclays also increased hiring dramatically during the period.

However, while MDs came in one door, they went out another. One bank is estimated to have ended the year down 23 US MDs and Citi - which hired heavily in 2024  </news/citi-hiring-barclays-stifel>- is estimated to have ended the year down eight. 

The figures in the chart do not reflect MDs created by internal promotions.

By Sheffield Haworth's reckoning, last year's biggest US MD hirer was Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo ended 2025 with 21 more MDs than it began, not counting internal promotions.

Fernando Rivas </news/wells-fargo-md-hiring>, head of Wells Fargo's corporate and investment bank, told the FT  <https://www.ft.com/content/f5ac8471-184e-4425-bd4e-8c2d0197c3d7>earlier this month that the bank intends to add 25-30 new managing directors (MDs) in 2026, and then again in 2027, following on from the 125 investment bank MDs it's hired since 2019.

            <description><![CDATA[JPMorgan's quest to implement AI </news/how-to-get-a-banking-ai-job> has continued in 2026. It just hired a veteran AI technologist that spent the last two decades working on technology for investment bankers.  </news/what-is-an-investment-bank>Now, though he's doing something a little different.

Follow eFinancialCareers on Google News here. <https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV1ZtYVc1aGJtTnBZV3hqWVhKbFpYSnpMbU52YlNnQVAB?ceid=GB:en&oc=3> 

Ronald Jansen  </news/2018/08/ubs-poaches-goldman-sachs-veteran-run-data-lab>is joining JPMorgan in New York as its head of AI for human resources and employee experience. He spent the last seven years at UBS, where he was an MD and global head of its AI lab in its global banking division. Before that he spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs, eight of which as an MD, where he led a team of strats  </news/strats-jobs-investment-banks>working on M&A, capital markets and derivatives structuring.

JPMorgan made multiple MD-level hires in its HR and employee experience division last year. Matt Brandt </news/the-new-jp-morgan-technology-md-that-might-decide-if-you-re-cut-or-promoted> joined in July as its head of data and analytics from Morgan Stanley. A month later, the bank hired a head of talent transformation </news/jp-morgan-s-new-head-of-talent-transformation-suggests-a-rise-in-moneyball-promotions> from tech consultancy Accenture.

AI is already part of the performance review process at JPMorgan. Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/why-bosses-are-using-ai-for-performance-reviews> reported in November that the bank has allowed managers to use internal AI bots to write reviews. It's not the first bank to do so; Jane Fraser said in October <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/citi-looks-to-ai-to-help-bosses-write-performance-reviews> that there were supposedly cheers at Citi when the bank announced staff could use AI to assess performance.

The technology Jansen will develop at JPMorgan may decide who gets promoted... or cut. CEO Jamie Dimon said at Davos <https://www.hrgrapevine.com/us/content/article/2026-01-22-jp-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-says-governments-should-help-manage-ai-workforce-shift> last month that he expects JPMorgan to have fewer employees in five years time, and has already been eliminating entire categories of job </news/jpmorgan-ai-jobs> thanks to AI

            <description><![CDATA[If you're an associate </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds> somewhere like Bank of America </news/bank-of-america-associates-got-their-bonuses-and-they-feel-nostalgic>, your bonus </news/london-bankers-bigger-bonuses-are-fraught-with-complexity> may not be the best this year. But if you're a vice president (VP) at somewhere like PJT </news/pjt-q4-2025>, your reward may feel ample indeed.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Meridith Dennes, a former banker turned recruiter of bankers in New York City, says vice presidents have been allocated exceptional bonuses for 2025. She says elite first year VPs have had bonuses hiked 34% to earn median total compensation (bonus plus salary) of $500k (£365k), Elite third year VPs at bulge bracket banks are now on median total compensation of $740k (£541k), says Dennes. 

VPs are typically in their late 20s.

Not every is an elite VP, though. Mediocre VPs are less well rewarded. If you're not a VP at a big US bank or top boutique,  </news/boutique-investment-banks>but you work for the middle market </news/2023/02/middle-market-banking-jobs>, your pay will be less. Nor will you be a desired employee. "We're seeing more large, complex transactions - $5 billion-plus deals, AI-related acquisitions, transformational mergers," says Dennes. "Banks need VPs who've already operated at that scale."  Midmarket VPs are therefore out of favour, however hard they grind.  </news/baird-industrials>

Tom Ragland, CEO of recruitment firm Harrison Rush Group, confirms that VPs are banks' most sought after people in 2026. "Banks are paying up for execution support at the VP level. Associates have not had the opportunity to work on many deals," he observes. Banks need people who are ready to run; deals are expected to roar back this year.

It's not just about avoiding the midmarket. The VPs who are at a premium now are a particular breed. Good is longer measured simply in deal count. "It's deal quality and contribution level," says Dennes. The preference is for VPs who have been "meaningfully involved" in deals and who have interacted directly with C-suite executives. 

VPs who have this kind of experience can switch between boutiques and big banks to maximize pay. Dennes says elite boutiques pay 20-25% more than banks in total compensation to their VP 1s and 2s. However, banks pay more than boutiques to their VP 3s. 

The new pathway to earnings maximisation may therefore be to start with a bank, leave for a boutique, and then return where you came from. This looks different to last year </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses>, when a salary and bonus survey from Instagram account Litquidity found that VP3 pay was highest ($750k) in elite boutiques and $75k less in banks.

On the odd occasion, though, VP3s may still earn more in boutiques. Ragland says the highest pay he's seen at that level this year was $800k and that it wasn't in a bank.

            <description><![CDATA[Working in electronic trading </news/high-frequency-trading-hiring-and-pay> opens up a lot of doors, but some are much more unusual than others. Ben Hansen spent six years in the sector, working across Headlands Technologies and Hudson River Trading </news/working-for-hudson-river-trading> (HRT). Latterly, he was a tech lead that helped set up HRT's credit trading business. Now, he spends his time developing toys for children.

Follow eFinancialCareers on Google News here. <https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqMggKIixDQklTR3dnTWFoY0tGV1ZtYVc1aGJtTnBZV3hqWVhKbFpYSnpMbU52YlNnQVAB?ceid=GB:en&oc=3> 

Hansen left HRT in 2022 to found Boppo <https://boppo.com/>, a screen-free tablet that provides 40 different games and activities using ten buttons. It was inspired by his experience working at home with a one-year-old child for HRT during COVID; </news/2023/08/jane-street-remote-working-tools> "If I was on the computer working late, he'd come over and start clicking the keys with me," he said. Hansen, who was a manager at the time, missed being an individual contributor, so he learned electronics and circuitry to put Boppo together. He told us he "enjoyed being an absolute beginner again."

There are some surprising similarities between Hansen's work at HRT and his current work at Boppo. The tablet uses a microcontroller instead of a CPU to be price-competitive, which comes with "a lot of memory constraints." Boppo's software is written primarily in Rust,  </news/rust-vs-c-plus-plus-financial-services-low-latency>with "some C and C++ </news/low-latency-c>" to address that issue. Hansen said that the focus with Boppo is more on performance than latency, as the tablet only needs to be as fast as human perception, but performs a lot of tasks simultaneously.

One of the biggest differences is user experience, which is "very different" for a child compared to a trader, who will often optimize their screen by a matter of pixels </news/jane-street-s-traders-on-1-4m-have-fighter-pilot-eyes-high-pain-thresholds> to deal with high information density. Boppo has a stripped back interface that guides children to certain tasks through sound and lighting. 

Work-life balance </news/jane-street-pay-hourly> is very different for Hansen today. He told us he's "working later nights here than I ever did for HRT... the peak stress is way more, but there are times when there's less stress." Working in a startup means, as the adage goes, that Hansen is wearing many more hats, which has been a challenge "because I found out like I'm really not good in a lot of other areas like marketing."

            <description><![CDATA[If Goldman Sachs is right,  </news/hedge-fund-hiring-2026>2026 will be another big year for hedge fund hiring. This year, it found that a net 45% of asset allocators </news/david-solomon-goldman-sachs-pay> plan to increase hedge fund exposure - the highest level ever for the survey since 2017.

More assets usually mean more portfolio managers </news/2023/09/portfolio-manager-job-hedge-fund> and more support staff. This may explain why some hedge funds have started this year by adding the sorts of business development  </news/as-hedge-funds-churn-talent-their-super-recruiters-are-more-important-than-ever>staff that help them find new talent.

Schonfeld, for example, has just onboarded BlueCrest's  </news/bluecrest-mike-platt>global head of business development, Michael Grad, in New York City. Grad is not joining as a bus dev guy specifically but as the 'chief investment initiatives officer', which could conceivably include investing in human beings.

Citadel, which Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/business-development-execs-left-citadel-past-year-2025-11> says lost seven business development professionals last year, had replenished its ranks with Justas Povilenas, a former recruiter who's just arrived in London to focused on hiring in fixed income, and with Alana Althens, who arrived from Moody's in New York to focus on adding talent in equity quant research.

And Brevan Howard, which has had some turnover </news/hedge-fund-brevan-howard-parted-with-company-with-7-senior-technologists> in its technology team has hired quant recruiter Rhydian Lawrence to work in business development in London, as well as Oscar Willett who previously spent 17 years at search firm the Omerta Group. 

The inflow of business development professionals is not the only positive indicator for hedge fund hiring. Investment staff are moving too. Most notably, Citadel added Florent Bénichou as head of US fixed income portfolio finance in January. Bénichou, a mathematics graduate of the prestigious École polytechnique in Paris was previously head of repo and indexing for the Americas at Credit Agricole.

            <description><![CDATA[Paul Taubman’s boutique investment bank </news/boutique-investment-banks>, PJT Partners, published its Q4 of 2025 results <https://ir.pjtpartners.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/110/pjt-partners-inc-reports-record-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-2025-results> today. On the face of it, they were pretty good – even if the bank doesn’t seem to be celebrating too much.

The headline figures were strong. Both the firm’s revenue and profit reached record highs, up by 15% and 30% on 2024’s results respectively, to $1.7bn and $310m. 

Curiously, however, the firm didn’t do much hiring in Q4. Headcount was down by two people in the last quarter: PJT reported that it employed 1,226 people at the end of Q3 2025 – and just 1,224 at the end of Q4. That isn’t to say it made cuts (people do leave of their own accord after all), but it also didn’t hire enough to make up the shortfall.

Perhaps more disappointingly for PJT’s people, pay did not go up as dramatically as revenue or profit did, despite the reduced headcount. Average pay per head at the bank went from $903k on average in 2024 to $946k on average in 2025, an increase of “just” 4.8%. 

Despite the slow Q4, overall headcount was still up for the year as a whole, going from 1,143 souls to 1,224, an increase of 7%. The number of partners – revenue generators – also went up, from 119 to 133 across the year, an increase of 12%. The majority of the new partners were in M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs>.

The firm had its usual gushing praise from staff in its earning presentation. “Outstanding people,” is how one anonymous contributor described colleagues, “with strong intellectual curiosity, passion, humor and empathy.” They make PJT “an incredible place to work,” apparently.

Yesterday, Winton de St. John-Pryce announced he was joining the bank in Hong Kong as an MD and head of advisory </news/what-are-ma-jobs> for Asia (excluding Japan). He previously spent 20 years at Morgan Stanley, where he made MD in 2019 and was most recently chief operating officer of APAC investment banking. For the last few years, however, he has been running his own boutique firm, Drekar Group, based in Hong Kong but operating across both Asia and the US.

Nomura's financial year ends in March. Last quarter, the Japanese bank made record advisory revenues; De St. John-Pryce's arrival may help maintain this momentum to close the year out.

I found the insider on LinkedIn. I was networking there as I prepared for summer internship </news/internship-investment-bank> applications and I approached a young trader at a leading US bank. He mentioned that he sometimes gave classes to students and we got talking.

I don't think he did that. I am not even sure now whether he worked for the bank he claimed to work for and I don't think he was a trader.

Either way, I spent the money but I have no internship or job. I ended up applying for 50 internships in total, all without success. I was at a non-target university. </news/target-universities-finance-uk>

            <title>Morning Coffee: When JPMorgan ousted a steady male banker for one with dubious tastes. ExodusPoint&#39;s prolonged revival</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Hindsight is a fine thing and if it were applied to the case of Jes Staley and Bill Winters when they were at JPMorgan, things would probably turn out differently.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Winters, now aged 64, has had a career unmarked by scandal. Married to the same eclectic theatre director <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/13/building-ideas-creatives-spaces-inspire-them> for years, his most risqué moment was the exposure of a nipple <https://www.cityam.com/heres-new-standard-chartered-chief-executive-bill-winters-bare-chested-doing-falsetto/> in a fundraising video during 2015.

And yet, in 2009 the well-liked Winters was famously ousted  </news/2009/09/five-possible-outcomes-from-the-swift-departure-of-bill-winters-at-jp-morgan>as co-head of JPMorgan's investment bank by disgraced banker Jes Staley. As of yesterday, we now know that Staley spent the following year in contact with Jeffrey Epstein, and that during that time he sent a woman in Epstein's purview instructions to dress up in a Snow White costume so that he could "take photos," possibly more. 

Having a Disney fetish should not be career-ending. Staley's problem is that it was facilitated by Epstein, who had been convicted of sex offences involving minors in 2008. Staley's problem is that he subsequently denied all knowledge of Snow White in court, where he also proclaimed no knowledge of Epstein's “monstrous activities.”   

As Staley is once again dragged through the residue of his relationship with Epstein, Winters - who has been happily running Standard Chartered since 2015 - can be excused a moment of schadenfreude. As accounts from the time make clear, <https://www.ft.com/content/a91dc5fc-ad25-11de-9caf-00144feabdc0> the mild-mannered Winters was rudely displaced by Staley in the run-up to his 48th birthday in 2009. Winters, who had successfully steered JPMorgan's investment bank through the financial crisis, <https://www.seattletimes.com/business/jpmorgan-dumps-exec-who-kept-it-out-of-risky-complicated-investments/> had no idea what was coming. "It was a complete bolt from the blue,”one colleague told the FT <https://www.ft.com/content/a91dc5fc-ad25-11de-9caf-00144feabdc0> of his firing at the time.

A good banker was replaced by a bad one. Maybe JPMorgan could send a retrospective apology.

Separately, it wasn't so long ago that hedge fund ExodusPoint was losing AUM and suffering shrinking headcount.  </news/exoduspoint-hedge-fund-hiring>Now, the fund is on a roll.

Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/january-hedge-fund-performance-citadel-schonfeld-2026-2> reports that ExodusPoint returned 1.8% in January after 2025 was its best year ever. Citadel and Schonfeld both returned 1%, by comparison. 

Meanwhile...

Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler asked Jeffrey Epstein to help her get a job at Facebook. He said:“I suggest you prep for your meeting as a case. Read up mark, sheryl, prepare an opening and summary. Along with a case strategy. III help.” She said: "These decade-old private emails you are selectively referencing and pruriently reporting on have nothing to do with my work at Goldman Sachs.” (Financial Times)  <https://www.ft.com/content/1fdb1850-7ff8-4ca5-bc91-f4b683aad063>

Peter Mandelson sought advice from Jeffrey Epstein on a job offer worth up to $6m from Deutsche Bank. In 2010, he seemed to have an offer with a salary of $1m (£733k) with scope for a bonus of between $3m and $9m, in line with what “a senior banker would be paid in the UK market”.

            <description><![CDATA[Deutsche Bank is no longer in full scale expansion mode. But nor has it sworn-off hiring entirely. At last year's investor day, it proclaimed its intention of hiring </news/deutsche-bank-gently-trimmed-45-people-in-q4-while-hiking-pay> bankers to cover "industrials, FIG, healthcare and tech," while also increasing its presence in US flow credit trading and US securitized products.

One month into 2026, there are signs that Deutsche is indeed making senior hires, but not in any of these areas.

In New York, the German bank has recruited two managing directors from Citi, one to cover structured rates products, and one to handle regulation.

Andrew Sufka joined DB this month as head of US rates risk management solutions. He previously spent 11 years at Citi, latterly in corporate derivatives.

Rosalie Yee also joined DB this month from Citi, as head of US bank regulatory legal. Yee previously occupied a similar role at Citi, where she worked for nearly three years. 

Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Sufka's arrival. Coincidentally or not, Pedro Goldbaum, </news/pedro-goldbaum-deutsche-bank> Deutsche's head of rates trading, also worked for Citi not so long ago. 

Yee seems a fine fit for Deutsche Bank. Both Deutsche and Citi have had brushes with US regulators. DB was fined $186m <https://www.ft.com/content/c8ca8f31-b090-49f2-8a67-6467deed8b03> in 2023 for problems with its US controls. Citi was fined $400m in 2020 for deficiencies in internal controls, followed by $136m in 2024 for failing to fix them. <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-bank-regulators-fine-citi-136-million-failing-address-longstanding-data-2024-07-10/> Speaking a few weeks ago, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said the bank is closely to attaining its "target" state in the wake of these fines.

            <description><![CDATA[What if there were a platform, spun out of a leading hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job>, offering 'multi-agent generative investment copilots (MAGIC) </news/brevan-howard-s-ai-spinoff-is-using-ll-ms-to-turn-analysts-into-quants>,' to help with the investment process? If successful, it might put some hedge fund professionals out of a job.

Fortunately, then, there may not be.

SigTech, the multigenerative AI platform that spun out of Brevan Howard in 2019 as a 'next generation quant  </news/quant-jobs-finance>platform,' seems to have been relegated to the last generation withouth anyone noticing. Its website  <https://www.sigtech.com/>is no longer functioning and a Companies House  <https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11686070/filing-history>filing shows that founder and CEO Bin Ren was terminated as an employee in late December.

We haven't spoken to Bin Ren for this article and Brevan Howard declined to comment.

SigTech debuted its MAGIC product at Bloomberg Invest in 2025, boasting <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sigtech-magic-now-available-microsoft-teams-store-appsource-ocype/?trackingId=ZWzg4SZLCsVQl8i8MVY2XQ%3D%3D> that it could solve "domain specific problems" across macro research, equities fundamental analysis, and commercial loan underwriting. MAGIC was powered by "AI agents" based on "a carefully chosen Large Language Model," said SigTech. Those agents could accomplish tasks autonomously. 

It's possible, then, that SigTech's agents might still be out there somewhere, solving problems. Bin Ren may have moved on to better things. A self-confessed child prodigy, Ren's LinkedIn profile says he was previously chief investment officer of Brevan Howard's Systematic Investments Group, before founding Elwood Technologies to manage crypto investments for Brevan Howard in 2018. Only then did he go agentic.

It's not clear what happened to SigTech's other people. Speaking in 2021, Ren said SigTech employed 50 people. 

The revelation that SigTech may have vanished comes as Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/tekmerion-spins-out-of-brevan-howard-with-1-billion-hedge-fund?utm_medium=email&utm_source=author_alert&utm_term=260202&utm_campaign=author_19458291> is reporting that Tekmerion Capital Management is spinning out of Brevan Howard less than two years after joining. The data-driven hybrid systematic macro fund will be partnering with Engineer's Gate for infrastructure support and capital instead.

            <description><![CDATA[Last week, we looked at how much software engineers earned at JPMorgan. </news/tech-pay-jpmorgan-software-engineer> Data from Levels.fyi <https://levels.fyi> suggests it's more lucrative to work at Goldman Sachs </news/how-to-get-a-job-goldman-sachs> instead.

Based on over 650 Levels.fyi datapoints from Goldman Sachs engineers </news/goldman-sachs-tech-fellows> in the US, UK and India since the start of 2025, we've found out the average engineering pay at each seniority of the bank in those regions. Goldman engineers outearned JPMorgan at each seniority in each location.

Engineering analysts at Goldman in the US earn ~15% more on average than those at JPMorgan, while engineers in Goldman's global capacity centre (GCC) </news/h1b-visa-investment-banking-jos> in India earn almost 40% more than JPMorgan's Indian analysts. As you progress up the ranks, the disparity between the banks narrows.

It's worth noting, however, that Goldman's VP class on Levels,fyi includes executive directors while EDs are broken out as their own class at JPMorgan.

What kinds of engineers earn the most at Goldman Sachs?

While JPMorgan's engineers had a lot of variation depending on what field they worked, pay is much more uniform at Goldman. Still, some types of engineers are better paid than others.

While full-stack engineers </news/2021/05/goldman-sachs-tech-stack> were some of the lowest paid technologists at JPMorgan, the opposite is true at Goldman. They earn $127.7k on average, more than any other major engineering type.

AI engineers came in second, earning $123.7k on average, but this pales in comparison to JPMorgan, where they earn over $200k.

            <description><![CDATA[Last week, we looked at how much software engineers earned at JPMorgan. </news/tech-pay-jpmorgan-software-engineer> Data from Levels.fyi <https://levels.fyi> suggests it's more lucrative to work at Goldman Sachs </news/how-to-get-a-job-goldman-sachs> instead.

Based on over 650 Levels.fyi datapoints from Goldman Sachs engineers </news/goldman-sachs-tech-fellows> in the US, UK and India since the start of 2025, we've found out the average engineering pay at each seniority of the bank in those regions. Goldman engineers outearned JPMorgan at each seniority in each location.

Engineering analysts at Goldman in the US earn ~15% more on average than those at JPMorgan, while engineers in Goldman's global capacity centre (GCC) </news/h1b-visa-investment-banking-jos> in India earn almost 40% more than JPMorgan's Indian analysts. As you progress up the ranks, the disparity between the banks narrows.

It's worth noting, however, that Goldman's VP class on Levels,fyi includes executive directors while EDs are broken out as their own class at JPMorgan.

What kinds of engineers earn the most at Goldman Sachs?

While JPMorgan's engineers had a lot of variation depending on what field they worked, pay is much more uniform at Goldman. Still, some types of engineers are better paid than others.

While full-stack engineers </news/2021/05/goldman-sachs-tech-stack> were some of the lowest paid technologists at JPMorgan, the opposite is true at Goldman. They earn $127.7k on average, more than any other major engineering type.

AI engineers came in second, earning $123.7k on average, but this pales in comparison to JPMorgan, where they earn over $200k.

            <description><![CDATA[Millennium, the multistrategy hedge fund </news/big-multistrategy-hedge-funds>, has hired a managing director from Goldman Sachs </news/how-to-get-a-job-goldman-sachs> and he is now expanding the fund's data centres team.

Christian Blanc, who spent over six years at Goldman in London after time at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, joined Millennium this month as the London-based deputy head of networks and data centres. In this role, Blanc is already hiring a new engineer for the fund's two London data centres, which provide power, cabling and security for Millennium's multiple London office technology rooms.

Millennium declined to comment on Blanc's arrival. At Goldman Sachs, he latterly worked on the Foundational Infrastructure team under partner Orla Dunne.

Data centres everywhere are being upgraded to support the AI boom. Goldman Sachs  <https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-ai-is-transforming-data-centers-and-ramping-up-power-demand>forecast last year that AI will account for 28% of the data centre market by the end of 2026.

Millennium has a global head of AI in the form of Gideon Mann, who joined from Bloomberg in 2023. It also has a head of AI for equities in the form of Mike Purewal, who joined from BofA the same year. In total, the firm currently has over 20 vacancies for which AI is an integral part of the role. Among other things, it's building an AI research agent.

AI needs data centres but it also needs data. In December, Millennium also hired Alexei Dvoretskii from Radix Trading as head of high speed historic market data and simulation. Dvoretskii once did a similar job at Tower Research.

In a separate incident of infrastructure hiring, Bob Van Zant, who was a principal software engineer at Citadel before disappearing on gardening leave in early 2025, has just reappeared at Balyasny as an infrastructure manager working with on-premises cloud.

            <description><![CDATA[Monday morning. 10am. Thirty minutes after the stock market opening bell.

I am pulled out of an intense bout of concentration by a hard slap on my back from my boss.

"Pull your trades and get the hell out of the building.”

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Those were the words that were spoken, but all I heard was the sheer expression of horror dominating his face.

Inaction. Paralysis.

For what felt like an eternity, but must have been no more than a fraction of a second.

Then a dead sprint to the stairwell. If everyone else was running, I was going to run too.

Terrorist attack? Fire? Had our entire division just been dissolved?

Rationality was impossible. Instinct was unavoidable.

The stairwell is at first eerily quiet. More than a hundred of the world’s most intelligent, resourceful, inventive individuals, completely out of their element. An army of “I got this” personalities who don’t got this. Directors without direction. Controllers without control. Risk managers  </news/risk-job-investment-bank>facing actual risk.

The effect is crippling, but the descent commences.

Floor 47. 46. 45.

No one is going fast enough.

Then the whispers begin.

Airplane. Something about an airplane.

Really, airplane? Shouldn’t we already be dead if an airplane had hit the building? But then again, it took the towers some time to fall. So maybe this is a race against time. Maybe the building is already on its way down and we have to beat it there.

The pregnant woman in front of me is not going fast enough.

The stairwell is too crowded to pass, and no one wants to be that guy forcing his way past a pregnant woman during a mass evacuation. I briefly consider asking if she would like help, imagining that a survivor might later tell the heroic tale of how I went down with honor.

Then I wonder if it might be useful to have an HOV lane.

With maximum speed unattainable, natural instinct takes over again and the multitasking begins.

The BlackBerrys emerge in force.

No one makes a phone call, unwilling to translate confused emotions into audible words, but the just-in-case “I love you” text messages must have been ubiquitous. I manage to send one before shouts of “get off the freakin’ BlackBerrys” cause me to slip mine back into my pocket.

They were right. My father would have been pleased to hear from me in my final moments, but he would have been even more pleased if these were not my final moments.

It doesn’t matter though. No one is going fast enough.

Floor 39. 38.

“Twenty five percent of the way there.”

Even in the face of death, long division is not a problem for PhDs in economics. The triathletes begin to get frustrated with the mathletes.

Floor 23. 22.

Calves burning. Moans of fatigue and fear.

I search for a familiar face.

“How you doing?” he asks

I want to tell him how my brain has accepted death, but my mind still believes in my invincibility. All I manage is a weak “alright,” which comes out as “right,” my voice cracking on the first syllable.

Floor 10. 9.

The end is in sight. Maybe I will make it after all.

But how does one go back from death to life? And now my mysterious text messages are going to cause some unnecessary concern. I better call as soon as I get down to let everyone know that everything is fine.

With one final burst, we spill out of the stairwell, into the lobby, and through the front door.

Oxygen. Daylight.

No screams. No blood. No debris.

I look up. The building is still standing.

Just chaos on the street. Feverish phone calls, text messages, and emails as people declare their “alrightness” and try to figure out what happened.

Then the email from corporate headquarters.

Air Force One, followed closely by an F-16 fighter jet, had flown just a little too close to our building during a photo shoot.

A photo shoot?

No apology. No explanation. Just the information, delivered with the calm neutrality normally reserved for system maintenance alerts.

It better have been a damn good photograph.

Early last year, Reuters reported that it planned to launch two new Japan-focused funds <https://www.reuters.com/markets/wealth/hong-kong-hedge-fund-polymer-joins-rush-debut-pure-japan-funds-sources-say-2025-03-18/>, with one involving a team of ~30 portfolio managers (PMs). Going into 2026, Japan still seems a big focus, but the fund has also been shoring up its ranks at home.

Last week, Watson Lau joined the fund as a portfolio manager based in Hong Kong. He spent the last two years at Balyasny in Hong Kong, </news/where-do-portfolio-managers-work-balyasny> working on its long/short equities fund. Before that, he was an investment analyst at Steve Cohen's hedge fund, Point72, for seven years.

Polymer made a few senior PM in the latter half of last year. In September, it hired Larry Cho, a former Millennium  </news/how-to-get-a-job-at-hedge-fund-millennium>PM who was most recently head of research at Xingtai Capital, another Hong Kong hedge fund. He was out of the market since the end of 2024, however. 

In July, Polymer brought in Tokyo-based portfolio manager Takehiro Yamamoto from SMBC's asset management arm, where he was chief portfolio manager for its ESG equity long/short fund. The fund is continuing to hire in Japan this year, hiring business development <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/hedge-funds-hire-talent-scouts-in-japan-to-tap-market-comeback> specialists in the country to recruit PMs.

            <description><![CDATA[The last time that Michael Roberts </news/hsbc-is-increasingly-run-by-people-who-ve-joined-from-citi>, the ex-Citi corporate banker running HSBC's corporate and investment bank, suggested his new home is becoming superior to Wall Street banks, it didn't land well internally.  </news/hsbc-townhall-emojis>Undeterred, Roberts is strumming the same song.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

In the Financial Times  <https://www.ft.com/content/3329ee04-b5d5-4393-a00c-640d6358ef92>today, Roberts says HSBC's aim is to become the number one corporate and institutional bank (CIB) globally. HSBC, which has a $3.2trn balance sheet, can compete with JPMorgan, which has a $4trn balance sheet, says Roberts. Jamie Dimon beware.

Roberts spent 33 years at Citi before joining HSBC in 2019. At Citi, he was a lending officer and global head of corporate banking. At HSBC, Roberts' focus is the areas he knows - he says the bank can compete most vigorously with JPMorgan in payments and transaction services. “We’re not a big investment bank," he declares. "We are a 99 per cent corporate commercial bank." JPMorgan is both.

HSBC combined its corporate and institutional banks in late 2024 and then shrank its investment bank this time last year.  </news/hscb-closure-europe-us-job-cuts>The unexpected closure of the M&A and ECM businesses outside of Asia and the Middle East was seen by some insiders as brutal </news/hsbc-job-cuts>. Quoting unnamed sources, the FT says it resulted in 25% of HSBC's CIB managing directors (MDs) being cut. 

Like HSBC's CEO Georges Elhedery </news/hsbc-s-self-proclaimed-ruthless-ceo-is-not-its-most-feared-person>, Roberts is unapologetic. There were "a lot of double roles, a lot of duplication, a lot of inefficiencies," he tells the FT. There was "excess cost," "excess people." Last June, </news/hsbc-bankers-pay> an unnamed senior executive at HSBC told the Financial Times  <https://www.ft.com/content/61e8d4e1-e49b-4048-9998-d33ac5f87d8e>HSBC had been paying many MDs seven figures for doing nothing much.

As Roberts reshapes the bank, his deputy Gerry Keefe </news/hsbc-s-self-proclaimed-ruthless-ceo-is-not-its-most-feared-person> has become known internally as his henchman. Roberts admits to finding it "frustrating" that some people are still not on the bank's combined CIB bus. As he seeks to make the bank a debt powerhouse, he still needs debt capital markets bankers to originate, package and distribute its loans. Last year, HSBC's DCM bankers were grumbling </news/hsbc-retention-bonuses> about poor pay. Several have since left of their own accords. </news/hsbc-s-dcm-people-are-slipping-away-before-bonuses-are-paid> If HSBC wants to be the top CIB, maybe their bonuses will be bigger this year.

Separately, as private equity  </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity>firms struggle with exits that don't involve their own secondary funds, Forbes <https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2026/01/29/why-private-equity-is-suddenly-awash-with-zombie-firms/> has assembled a helpful list of 20 zombies that you possibly don't want to work for now. 

We are not listing the zombies, some of whom already appear to be objecting to that designation but you can see them all here.  <https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2026/01/29/why-private-equity-is-suddenly-awash-with-zombie-firms/>Many seem to be busy raising continuation funds to buy their previous funds containing investments they haven't been able to exit. 

“If you had two good funds and then a bad fund, you have some hope. You’ve got to convince people that the next fund will be better,” declares Steven Kaplan, who specialises in private equity at University of Chicago. “If you’ve had two bad funds, you’re probably out of luck.”

            <description><![CDATA[I am a female banker working in the Asian markets. Whenever I hear of people discussing sexist attitudes in banking, </news/some-female-citi-m-ds-created-a-site-to-share-women-s-banking-horror-stories> it is in relation to London or New York. What people don't understand is that it can be even worse in Asia.

Male bankers in Asia often think they have a right to treat young females however they like. If you try to object to this, they can make your life very difficult indeed. The men have all the power here and in my experience the senior women will not help you. There are usually only one or two women on teams of 15 people and those women feel very exposed. They close ranks and side with the men. 

Wrongdoing is never discussed because when women leave banks where they've been mistreated, they always sign NDAs. These are often accompanied by packages which are big enough to persuade them to go quietly, but small compared to the amounts that the senior men are paid.

I've tried to speak out about the sexism I've experienced and it has made my life very difficult and been damaging to my career. I've had no messages of support from the other women who are very aware of my situation. I'm struggling and I would like to urge other women to take a stand when they see things they disagree with.

            <title>UBS markets bonuses were fine, especially on the desk that lost 9 people </title>

            <description><![CDATA[Yesterday was UBS bonus day </news/ubs-bonuses-are-this-thursday-there-are-comings-and-goings-before-they-re-announced>. The early verdict seems to be that things weren't too bad, especially in the Swiss bank's markets business, where revenues rose 24% year-on-year. However, things seem to have been best of all on one London trading desk, which lost many of its people in 2025.

Insiders point to intense churn on Swiss bank's London rates desk. In the past year, at least nine people have left. Bonuses allocated to remaining staff on the desk are thought to be good. 

We reported some, but not all, of the exits earlier this week. </news/ubs-bonuses-are-this-thursday-there-are-comings-and-goings-before-they-re-announced> We now know that they also included Kyriakos Manolis, a senior USD swaps trader, who joined from Citadel in June and is said to have left UBS again in December. The FCA Register says he is still technically employed by the bank.

The other exits are: Dipo Abiola, who left in December to become head of UK insurance sales at UBS; Samuel Seyoum, a rates sales associate who left for Santander in June; Ali Sanai,  </news/a-ubs-sales-head-left-for-citi-one-year-after-being-promoted-to-md>a rates sales MD who left for Citi in March; Mark Samarasinghe, a senior rates trader who left for Deutsche Bank in September; George Dramitinos, a London-based rates trader, who left late last year; Jason Colloupas, who was trading Australian rates in London; and Yilin Liu, another junior, who's going to Deutsche Bank.

Insiders say that many of those who left were hired by Mark Tinworth, who joined RBC last July. He was replaced by Shane O’Cuinn, who spent a long time running Credit Suisse's non-core unit. O'Cuinn recently hired Kilian Frensch </news/kilian-frensch> from Nomura.

Away from the rates desk, UBS insiders say M&A bonuses were fine, but for the juniors who are complaining. Across markets as a whole it's thought there may have been a double digit rise.

UBS didn't respond to a request to comment. Like other banks, it pays for performance.

            <title>Kevin Warsh: The ex-Morgan Stanley VP with a wealthy wife</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/kevin-warsh-wife</link>

            <description><![CDATA[President Trump is nominating Kevin Warsh as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve. 

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Warsh has many things to recommend him for the role and is already receiving plaudits from the people that matter. The FT <https://www.ft.com/content/2030acc1-4026-4ad1-81bc-12754389f71d> says ex-Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein rates him "unflappable" in a crisis and <https://www.ft.com/content/a08f1b78-4816-4ff1-819c-e67e59c8d767> that Jamie Dimon voiced their support.

Warsh has a storied CV. </news/the-absolutely-perfect-investment-banking-cv> As Trump noted on Truth Social, Warsh is a Harvard and Stanford graduate who once worked in M&A for Morgan Stanley and who then became the Fed's youngest governor ever at the age of 35. 

As we reported in April,  </news/kevin-warsh>Warsh worked for Morgan Stanley between 1995 and 2002. He became a vice president and executive director (ED) at the bank during the dot com boom.  

In his post M&A existence, Warsh was on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve during the last financial crisis and helped counsel then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. He's latterly been working in Stanley Druckenmiller's family office. <https://www.ft.com/content/4ec81de7-eb59-4be8-81db-bff657e6c5d3> As Trump observes, Warsh appears to be out of "central casting" for the role of Fed Chair.

Warsh also has a wealthy wife. As Bloomberg notes, Warsh is married <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/trump-picks-a-reinvented-kevin-warsh-to-lead-the-federal-reserve?srnd=homepage-americas&sref=vuYGislZ> to Jane Lauder, the daughter of makeup scion and Republican donor Ronald Lauder, who is a former classmate of Trump's and who donated $5m in March to MAGA Inc. 

Forbes <https://www.forbes.com/profile/lauder/> says the Lauder family are worth nearly $26bn. Ronald was reportedly one of the first people to suggest to Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/ronald-lauder-billionaire-donor-donald-trump-ukraine-greenland> over six years ago that he buy Greenland. 

Trump said today that he has known Lauder for a "long period of time" and that he will be a "GREAT Fed chairman, maybe the best."

            <description><![CDATA[As we reported last week, </news/goldman-sachs-and-morgan-stanley-people-complain-of-poor-bonuses-away-from-the-front-office> while bonuses may have been mixed  </news/at-bank-of-america-some-equities-traders-would-like-bigger-bonuses>for front office </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking> bankers and traders this year, they seem more unambiguously disappointing for the middle and back office staff whose jobs are most susceptible to being automated out of existence.

Morgan Stanley appears to be a case in point. The bank still isn't commenting, but US-based operations staff in its wealth management division remain aggrieved by a change to their compensation structure.

It's understood that the bank flagged a change to the wealth management operations compensation structure at the end of 2024, making the 2025 bonus round the guinea pig. Insiders claim they were told they would receive larger base salaries in return for a drop in their bonuses. 

Instead, they claim that bonuses were cut while many of their salaries remained the same. To make matters worse, they say the new compensation structure has only been implemented at vice president level and below, with executive directors and managing directors still receiving bonuses. 

"I've had to tell people in my team that they won't be getting a bonus or a salary increase because their salary is already considered at the top of the pay range," says one operations VP at the bank. "They have been baffled and stunned. We had a great year and these are top performers." 

It may not only be Morgan Stanley where non-revenue generating staff are being squeezed. Insiders at Citi and Goldman Sachs have also complained about reduced bonuses in the middle and back office.

In the ideal world, banks would like people to leave voluntarily to avoid paying them severance. If so, AI may be around to take the strain. Lloyds' CEO Charlie Nunn  <https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/29/lloyds-charlie-nunn-warns-bankers-reskill-themselves-impact-ai>said yesterday that the bank can now use AI to process complaints in one second instead of five minutes. And Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier this month </news/banking-recruitment-s-sorry-story-more-candidates-fewer-jobs> that the bank " has built a capability" involving a "series of prompts" enabling it to reduce headcount in the audit team.

            <title>Nomura&#39;s bankers and equities traders will deserve their bonuses this year. FICC less so</title>

            <description><![CDATA[While other, mainly American banks have released their Q4 and 2025 full-year results, Japanese bank Nomura has released <https://www.nomuraholdings.com/en/investor/summary/finance.html> its Q3 results, also for the quarter ending December 2025. They were pretty good – mostly.

The happiest times were for Nomura’s investment bankers and equities traders. Across 2025 (the calendar year, not the financial year – Nomura’s financial year ends in March), revenue from the former was up by 6% on last year and the latter up by 22%. The equities result was particularly notable – the bank noted that its equities revenue reached a second consecutive record high. Banking revenue also reached an all-time high.

The bank credited the strong equities performance to “robust” performance in execution services and equity products. The strength of banking revenue came from strong equity capital markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> performance in Japan. 

There was less good news for the firm’s fixed income traders. Full-year revenue for 2025 declined by 5% compared to 2024, mostly due to a fall in the first quarter of the year of 14%. At the time, the bank blamed the decline on a fall in its rates and credit businesses, but they didn’t make up the shortfall across the rest of the year. All eyes on Q4.

Luckily, Nomura’s bonuses have historically been paid </news/investment-banking-bonus-schedule-calendar> in May, which is after the end of their financial year in March. That painful quarter might be discarded in calculations.

Nomura’s results were overshadowed by an ugly loss in Europe, as well as compensation scheme costs related to acquiring Macquarie’s asset management business. Japan Times <https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2026/01/30/companies/nomura-profit-fall/> said that the firm’s crypto asset business also posted a loss, and noted that the firm had a crypto subsidiary in Switzerland. Hedging against FX also impacted that loss, the firm said.

            <description><![CDATA[Historically, the appeal of leaving your corporate career behind in favour of a startup was the potential equity. Early employees at fintechs  </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-fintech>like Revolut </news/revolut-hiring-slows-down-average-pay> received company stock that became worth tens of millions </news/revolut-s-new-accounts-reveal-the-huge-pay-day-coming-to-some-employees> once their firms took off. If you join an early stage fintech today, it's a different story.

Accounting infrastructure firm Carta recently released a report <https://carta.com/data/resources/state-of-startups-2025/> that broke down the hiring and pay trends of startups using its platform. Unfortunately, the data only covers a period up to Q2'25, but it found that the average initial equity grant for employees joining a US-based startup in the month of June 2025 is 50% smaller than it was in April 2022. The average value of equity offers dropped starkly between November 2022 and September 2023, and have remained stagnant ever since. In that same time, salaries have increased but only marginally.

This is despite the fact that hiring for engineers, who typically earn higher equity packages, has increased. They made up 29.7% of new hires in H1 2025, up from ~25% in 2022. Operations staff made up just 5.2% of hires in 2025.

AI and machine learning engineers at startups are making more than ever. For the year ending June 2025, the average equity package for those technologists was up at least 19% across all seniorities. Senior directors received a 52% increase in equity pay alongside a 12.8% increase in salaries.

Hiring is stagnant across most industries, but fintech is ever-so-slightly growing. Total headcount in fintech grew by ~10% in 2025; by contrast headcount in gaming startups fell by 20% while education tech headcount fell by 40%

Fintech may be faring better outside the US. A recent report <https://www.morganmckinley.com/uk/article/finance-hiring-climbs-13-technology-and-fintech-drive-growth-across-uk> from recruitment firm Morgan McKinley found that fintech was the fastest growing sector in the UK's </news/top-london-fintechs> finance sector, with sale </news/sales-vs-engineering-jobs-fintech-startups>s roles up 47% year-on-year in 2025 and engineering roles up 71%. US fintechs have increasingly hired in London </news/london-is-the-new-cheap-location-for-new-york-fintechs-to-hire-engineers> in recent years, as you can pay up to 50% less for early/mid-level engineers.

            <description><![CDATA[Rick Rieder, what a guy! In a hagiographic account of Rieder's ride from Wharton to Lehman to BlackRock, Fortune <https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/rick-rieder-fed-chair-race-2-3-trillion-polymarket-kalshi-bond-trading/> details the phenomenal work ethic of one of the many men who might have been chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Rieder doesn't seem to sleep much. There are suggestions that he stops emailing at 11pm and starts emailing at 3am. In a podcast <https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/richer-wiser-happier/the-2-6-trillion-man-w-rick-rieder/> two years ago, Rieder said, “I hate the feeling of not being in control while sleeping.” A biometric ring monitoring his vitals reportedly revealed that his stress peaked at 11.30pm when he was forced to sleep despite Asian markets being opened. His stress was relieved at 3.45am, when he woke up and began trading again.

Despite being sleep-deprived, and plastering his house with signs declaring "Work hard, play hard, give back." Rieder is reportedly "magnetic" and known for his humility. He's attracted a troop of 42 followers, who follow him everywhere.

Fortunately, they will not need to pack their bags in the near future. Rieder, who is currently chief investment officer of global fixed income for BlackRock, is not becoming chairman of the Fed after all. The Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/e227d99a-3144-465a-8108-209fb7d433cb> says Kevin Warsh, formerly the youngest Fed governor ever, will be nominated as the next chairman today. Maybe Rieder can go to bed early as a result.

Separately, if you're a second year student who has done a summer internship </news/finance/internship-investment-bank> at a leading investment bank  </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-banking>or hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job>, you are briefly a person of extreme prestige and importance among your university peers, and ex-interns are absolutely making the most of this moment.

The FT <https://www.ft.com/content/4d1b3603-9d94-46d0-b70c-1dc28e5f7cc1> reports that second and third year students at elite schools who've previously completed prestigious internships are "throwing their weight around on campus" and acting as gatekeepers to elite finance societies that only a few can join. 

Business Insider had a similar story </news/college-finance-clubs> last year, in which it noted that the inflated interns running the clubs were reducing would-be members to tears with aggressive questioning during their interview process. Queues of people want to join; only 10% are admitted.

If you make it into one of the special clubs, you will be at an advantage over your peers. At the University of Chicago, the FT says elite finance club members get to attend a six-week training program and then take an exam. It's very stressful, but it prepares you for applying to finance jobs and you have privileged access to the most prestigious students on campus.

            <description><![CDATA[It was Bank of America bonus </news/bank-of-america-associates-got-their-bonuses-and-they-feel-nostalgic> day on Monday. Some of the bank's London equities EMEA equities professionals have since reached the conclusion that it was a poor start to the week.

Bank of America declined to comment for this article, but multiple equities professionals at the bank in EMEA said they were hoping for big bonuses and their hopes were not met. 

It's possible that we spoke only to poor performers with unreasonable opinions of their own talents. Our pre-Christmas bonus expectations survey </news/bonus-expectations-by-bank> found that BofA people across all business areas were expecting bonuses to increase by an average of 60%. If so, they were destined for disappointment.

Nonetheless, the BofA equities traders and salespeople </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank> we spoke to today, insist their hopes were not unreasonable. "We smashed it last year," says one. "In EMEA we hit our budget for equities in September." This has not been verified by the bank.

Bank of America's global equities revenues rose by 23% in the last quarter of 2025 and by 16% during the year as a whole. This was good, but not great compared to the 33% and 28% full-year equities revenue increases at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley respectively.

BofA's equities insiders say they were not, in fact, expecting a 60% increase in their bonuses and would have been happy with just 10-20%. Instead, many seem to have received increases substantially below this, with some middle and back office staff being zeroed. One EMEA quant said the average increase seemed to have been 2%.

Part of the problem appears to have been the unequal geographical distribution of revenues. US equities traders are thought to have done badly in the fourth quarter. Multiple insiders said European bonuses had been diverted to pay the US after the US subsidized EMEA bonuses in previous years.

Within equities, some areas did better than others from the bonus round. Structured products professionals and equity derivatives traders are thought to have been paid relatively well. Cash equities professionals are thought to have been paid badly.

Equity researchers  </news/research-job-investment-bank>at the bank have also been voicing complaints. One said the research bonus pool appeared to have increased only by single digits in percentage terms and considered analysts under-compensated relative to workload. Even researchers covering "broader energy and energy infrastructure, clean energy and the energy transition, defense and aerospace, healthcare services," had been paid poorly, he claimed.

A London research headhunter confirmed he's had "a lot of incoming" from BofA equity analysts interested in new roles. However, he also said it was unsurprising that pay was poor given low IPOs in Europe last year. "I don't think they understand the dynamics of research," he observed.

            <title>Ex-Barclays trader who quit to make NFTs won&#39;t get his job back. But it&#39;s okay</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Ovie Faruq was a good credit trader. He liked being a credit trader, even. But eventually the boredom of using only half of your brain got to him, and he quit for the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). That was in 2022.

It’s now 2026, and the NFT world has collapsed, for lack of better term. From a peak market size of $1.6bn in 2022, research from CoinLedger <https://coinledger.io/research/how-much-is-the-nft-market-worth> last year suggested it’s barely a third of that now. Bloomberg reported <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/gemini-to-close-nft-marketplace-nifty-gateway-in-february?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=twitter> earlier this week that Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini was planning to close its NFT marketplace by March.

Faruq is unfazed. In the OFF SCRIPT podcast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnPhB3d2R8c> yesterday, he said that his NFT style – Rekt guy – was launched during the NFT decline anyway. People could related to the Rekt Guy, because they were also Rekt guys. It was almost a metaphysical commentary.

Despite the NFT market being Rekt, Faruq has no interest in returning to the world of trading. "I could never go [back]”, he said. “If everything failed in my life and I needed to get a normal job, so to speak, I would do something different. I couldn't go back to it."

Despite leaving finance, Faruq has fond-ish memories of the experience. He told the OFF SCRIPT podcast that he loved the excitement of taking risks and credited the bank and his mentors there for teaching him a lot – and noted that he learned a lot about ethics, regulation, macroeconomics, and risk management. 

Eventually however, the risk-aversion made him quit. “If something didn’t go well for you, people would be quick to say you need to cut your losses. And it would be frustrating if you turned out to be right further down the line.”

Still, it’s not all negative. Rekt is a whole brand now. We’ve mentioned </news/ovie-faruq> their energy drink offerings before, which once upon a time sold for £60 for a case of 12 – now only £47, but still. There’s also the Rekt Coin <https://rekt.com/pages/rekt-coin>, the brand’s own meme coin. It currently has a market cap of around $81m, with a total supply of 420.69 trillion coins.

If you’re curious to know how Faruq’s NFTs are doing, we found an artwork in 2022 of a self-portrait (of sorts) was on sale for $3.4k (USD). It’s now on sale <https://opensea.io/item/ethereum/0xc23a563a26afff06e945ace77173e1568f288ce5/3> for $212. Just for reference.

            <description><![CDATA[I work for one of the well-known hedge funds </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job>. I'm not going to disclose my function because I do not want to be traced. Since I have worked here, the number of people coming and going has been astonishing.

It's common knowledge that hedge funds churn through portfolio managers </news/2023/09/portfolio-manager-job-hedge-fund>, who jump from fund to fund after drawdowns. To some extent, this is to be expected: portfolio managers are well paid  </news/pay-for-equity-portfolio-managers-vs-equity-researchers-in-london>and if they make a loss it is their issue.

I am not a portfolio manager. Nor are people in my team paid that kind of money. And yet, the fund seems to think it's ok to hire and fire arbitrarily as we're earning seven figures. 

This is a problem. I have seen people's careers being ruined. Signing up for a supporting role is not the same as signing up for a big pod. We don't get big bonuses and we are only as good as our last projects. Finding something new can be hard. 

The fund doesn't seem to care about this. It just keeps hiring and letting people go and pay them money to go quietly. In my opinion, it's playing fast and loose with people's livelihoods.

It will be interesting to see what happens to this approach if the UK government changes the rules regarding unfair dismissal </news/unlimited-compensation-for-unfair-dismissal-bankers-uk>. For the moment, people are tapped on the shoulder, given a payment for their hurt feelings and asked to leave immediately. My understanding is that this won't be possible in the future and that a proper process will have to be followed. I know many people will welcome that. It's not worth taking a job if you're just going to be fired for no reason.

            <description><![CDATA[Private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> has had a bit of a rough time of things recently, with exits plummeting and the favoured method of cashing out of investment recently being a game of hot potato </news/private-capital-advisory-jobs-investment-banking>. Private credit </news/2022/12/private-credit-jobs>, which has done better, is starting to face similar headwinds <https://www.ft.com/content/c071fa65-5517-4224-90c9-d73718165367>. But if things work out for the industry, however, there are still some huge pay packages on the table.

Data from recruitment consultancy Heidrick & Struggles suggests that top managing partners </news/private-equity-job-titles> at European private capital (including both private equity and credit) firms can earn compensation (salaries and bonuses) of up to €1.4m ($1.6m), as well as carried interest payments </news/what-is-carried-interest> of €37m ($44m), depending on the size of their employer – with bigger firms, known as megafunds, being more generous than smaller ones.

Heidrick says that slightly lower-tier partners, meanwhile, might expect salaries and bonuses of up to €957k ($1.1m) and carried interest payments of up to €24m ($29m). Principals, who are the equivalent of banking VPs or Directors </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds>, can expect compensation of up to €442k ($528k) and carried interest of up to €9m ($11m).

There is significant variation in carried interest payments depending on sector. Managing partners and regular partners working at buyout funds – “traditional” private equity – are the best paid, while those in venture capital are the worst paid (still millionaires, though).

Interestingly, despite the success of the private credit sector </news/2022/12/private-credit-jobs> in recent years, carried interest for its professionals is lacking. Carried interest paid to direct lending (the single largest component of private credit) partners and managing partners was significantly less than the carried interest paid to buyout partners and managing partners. 

It’s worth noting two things. The first is that carried interest is not a yearly payment – it’s based on a fund’s lifecycle performance, which is usually round five years. It’s also dependent on a fund being successfully exited, which is something that private equity funds have struggled with in recent years. We go into more detail in our carried interest article here </news/what-is-carried-interest>.

            <title>Lazard had an unremarkable year, but raised pay a tiny bit anyway</title>

            <description><![CDATA[After boutique bank </news/boutique-investment-banks> Lazard published its Q2 results this year, we noted </news/lazard-presentation> that its presentation were remarkable stale in between quarters. Although this seems to have changed (slightly), nothing much else seems to have happened at Lazard in 2025 – its Q4 results were published today, and it seemed to have had a very average year.

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community.  <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/login?_gl=1*ut8n6u*_gcl_au*MTg4MDY2NTExNi4xNzYxNTU3NDIz*_ga*ODczNzI2NTA0LjE3NTM2OTk2ODI.*_ga_NZFQV4MXPM*czE3NjM2NDM0MDYkbzI1NiRnMSR0MTc2MzY0MzQzOSRqMjckbDAkaDMyMjc4OTUzMw..>✍️

The average year was driven by average revenues. Total revenue increased by just 1%, from $3.14bn to $3.19bn. Those average revenues meant a drop in operating income for the bank, which fell by 15%, from $386m to $328m.

Pay, as a consequence, was pretty flat. The firm paid an average of $614k across 2024, and an average of $630k across 2025, an increase of less than 3%.

That can’t be blamed on substantial headcount increases, either. The firm’s wage bill increased by just 4%, and headcount barely budged, going from 3,263 people at the end of Q4 2024 to 3,309 at the end of Q4 2025, an increase of just 1.4%.

What might tie those two numbers is that a lot of the new hires would have been rather expensive: Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/lazard-doubles-md-hires-as-advisory-fees-hit-record-b6a2927b?mod=homepage> reported today that Lazard had hired "more than twice as many" MDs in 2025 as it did in 2024, when it hired 11. It also reported that the bank planned to hire 10-15 new MDs per year until 2030.

By its own account, Lazard is balancing its hiring appetite with its desire to save costs. “We focus on the adjusted compensation ratio to manage costs,” the firm said, “balancing a view of current conditions in the market for talent alongside our objective to drive long-term shareholder value,” related to Peter Orszag's Lazard 2030 strategy. Its managing of costs might have to wait for the future.

And, for what it’s worth, the number of Americans at the firm increased slightly: 53% of the firm's employees were based in the Americas across 2025, which was a return to form </news/lazard-q4-2024> after it spent a few quarters hiring Europeans. The percentage of employees based in APAC also declined, from 5% to 4%.

Dhanajay Singh Rathore has joined Standard Chartered in Dubai </news/work-in-banking-cannot-retire> as an MD and cluster head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He spent four and a half years at Deutsche Bank, also in Dubai, where he was a private banking team head for the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. 

Rathore also worked in the Middle Eastern private banks of Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and UBS. His early specialism was on high net-worth Indians working in the region.

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing has high hopes for his private bank. He said today that it "has made tremendous progress with its transformation," achieving returns of over 10% in 2025.

Standard Chartered, meanwhile, spent much of last year growing its UAE private banking team. It hired the head of HSBC's Middle East private bank,  <https://www.privatebankerinternational.com/news/standard-chartered-uae-private-banking-team/>as well as a senior MD from Julius Baer.  <https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/standard-chartered-expands-uae-private-banking-team-2025-05-21/>CEO Bill Winters said late last year <https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/banking/2025/10/29/standard-chartered-bets-on-affluent-business-to-boost-middle-east-growth/> that 5% of the bank's AUM is from its UAE private bank, but that "could become 15 per cent or 20 per cent" in the next few years.

Keith Yong joined HSBC last week to lead its operations </news/operations-jobs-banking> team in Singapore. He joined the bank from Swiss rival UBS, where he spent 20 years in its operations team. He was made an MD in 2024 </news/ubs-md-list>, and was most recently the bank’s head of global wealth management front support office in APAC.

HSBC is one of the better places to be in Singaporean wealth management. Bloomberg reported <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/hsbc-deepens-pivot-to-wealth-in-singapore-as-retail-pared> earlier this week that the bank was expanding its wealth management presence in the city at the expense of its retail efforts and was even converting retail branches into wealth centres for the push.

UBS has been restructuring. It shut thousands <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/ubs-to-shut-thousands-of-smaller-credit-suisse-accounts-in-asia> of smaller (under $2m) accounts that it inherited from Credit Suisse in the region in 2023 – the same year that it was embroiled in <https://www.acams.org/en/news/singapore-penalizes-9-financial-firms-over-2-3-billion-money-laundering-scandal> a $2.3bn money laundering scandal in the city state. It’s also cutting jobs in Singapore; Bloomberg reporting <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/ubs-25-year-asia-veteran-departs-ahead-of-new-wave-of-job-cuts> earlier this month that even 25+ year veterans of the bank are on the chopping block.

            <description><![CDATA[Goldman Sachs has some hot traders </news/top-goldman-traders>. The hottest among them now may be metals traders. With gold, silver and copper  <https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/why-record-high-copper-prices-arent-forecast-to-last>prices all breaking records <https://www.ft.com/content/f12a38cb-bf19-4f1f-b09b-53fbc62dc159>, metals traders are particularly desired. - Citadel </news/2022/10/how-to-get-a-job-at-citadel> is building <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/citadel-joins-trading-rush-into-metals-as-prices-soar-to-records> a new metals trading business. Deutsche Bank  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/deutsche-bank-makes-gold-trading-comeback-with-bumper-earnings>returned to gold trading in November. Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-26/gold-trader-hiring-spree-drives-up-pay-as-bullion-market-booms>reported in October that banks and hedge funds have been battling for precious metals traders and driving up their pay.

In this context, it's worth noting at Goldman Sachs' head of precious metals trading, Benjamin Binet-Laisne has chosen to join commodities trading  </news/commodities-trading-jobs-pay>firm Mercuria rather than a bank or a hedge fund </news/finance/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job>. Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/goldman-s-former-head-of-precious-metals-set-to-join-mercuria?utm_medium=email&utm_source=author_alert&utm_term=260128&utm_campaign=author_22490032>reported Binet-Laisne's move yesterday. 

He's not alone in selecting Mercuria as his preferred destination. Nick O'Kane, </news/nick-o-kane-macquarie-mercuria> Macquarie's top commodities trader also went there in 2024. 

What makes Mercuria so alluring? The appeal might be related to its combination of high profitability and low level of employees. The Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/4ad46815-da46-496f-bc8f-ca6e673aec3b> reported earlier this month that Mercuria generated $1.3bn in profits for 2025. The firm employs circa 1,300 people, implying profits of $1m per head. Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-10/mercuria-s-top-duo-shared-1-billion-payday-amid-energy-crisis> reported a few weeks ago that Mercuria's co-CEOs, Marco Dunand and President Daniel Jaeggi, shared dividends of $1bn for 2023. 

In this context, earning $47m as CEO of Goldman Sachs </news/david-solomon-goldman-sachs-pay> doesn't look as impressive. Citadel's pay  </news/pay-at-hedge-fund-citadel-in-london-500k-to-21mm>seems more appealing, particularly in the commodities team </news/citadel-hedge-fund-bonuses>, but Binet-Laisne obviously liked the look of Mercuria more.

Separately, Instagram personality High Yield Harry  <https://www.instagram.com/highyield.harry/?hl=en>has been telling some hard truths on X. <https://x.com/HighyieldHarry/status/2016266554149629984?s=20> "I think a lot of folks need to remember that your mid-20s to late 30s might be peak earnings years," he warns. "You should be saving a lot of money and compounding. If you get bounced from a seat, you might not get a new one."

Harry was referring to buy-side jobs at credit funds, where he says portfolio manager seats are limited compared to analyst jobs and therefore "you need to have high conviction that you’ll be a PM one day." However, a similar dynamic is coming to banking, where juniors in M&A tell us they're competing to make VP before AI automates roles out of existence.

            <description><![CDATA[Deutsche Bank's fourth quarter results are out  <https://investor-relations.db.com/files/documents/quarterly-results/2025/FDS-Q4-2025-29012026.pdf>and are not bad for all who work in its investment bank. Profits there were up 20% year-on-year last year. Revenues were up 9%. Headcount was up 3% in the front office </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking> and down by 1% in operations </news/operations-jobs-banking>, but pay was up 8%.

It may therefore be concluded that Deutsche Bank will pay individuals in the investment bank more for 2025 than for 2024. 

The German bank seems to indicate as much in the comments accompanying its results. Rising compensation costs in the fourth quarter were, "driven by higher accruals for performance related compensation", says CFO James Von Moltke.

In the case of Deutsche Bank, higher compensation costs are as much about salaries as bonuses. </news/deutsche-bank-bonuses-2025> While US banks like Citi </news/citi-salaries-london> are free of the EU bonus cap </news/bonus-cap> which limited bonuses to twice salaries in London (and continues to do so in the EU), as a German bank, Deutsche Bank is stuck with it. 

To the extent that bonuses are higher at Deutsche this year, they may go to its FX and emerging markets traders, who are credited with driving a 7% fixed income trading revenue increase in the final quarter. By comparison, Deutsche's advisory (M&A) </news/get-a-job-in-ma> bankers saw revenues fall 9% year-on-year in Q4 and rise by only 1% for the year as a whole. This was the worst performance of any bank to report so far, and comes despite years of heavy senior banker hiring.

Deutsche wants to hire some more senior bankers in 2025. Speaking at November's investor day, </news/deutsche-bank-s-investor-day> head of the investment bank Fabrizio Campelli said the bank wants to increase its presence across "industrials, FIG, healthcare and tech," while also increasing its presence in US flow credit trading and US securitized products.

With this in mind, perhaps, Deutsche Bank reduced net front office headcount in its investment bank by 45 people in Q4. Even if bonuses are good this year, those people won't be getting any.

In 2026, Deutsche says it expects fixed income sales and trading revenues to remain steady, although the year is off to a good start. Banking revenues are supposed to grow "in line with strategy."

            <description><![CDATA[It's bonus </news/ubs-bonuses-are-this-thursday-there-are-comings-and-goings-before-they-re-announced> season in banks, but it is also salary season. At many banks, salary increases appear to have been marginal. At Citi in London, we understand that material risk-takers (MRTs) have been signing contracts that actually lower their salaries, but pay their bonuses sooner.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

The changes come after pre-Christmas complaints that the bank had a two tier compensation system </news/citi-s-london-bankers-and-traders-are-complaining-about-two-tier-pay> in which historic managing directors (MDs) received high salaries with limited bonus potential, whereas new MDs received lower salaries with higher bonus potential. 

The high salaries paid to historic MDs at Citi reflected the requirements of the EU bonus cap, which restricted bonuses in London to 2x salaries. This was lifted </news/bonus-cap> for the current London bonus round, in which Citi said it might pay bonuses of up to 6x salaries instead. A subsequent loosening of the rules  </news/banking-bonuses-london>also provided for London banks to relax deferral conditions for material risk takers, most of whom are MDs. 

At Citi, insiders say the new lower MRT salaries are being accompanied by bonuses which vest within one year instead of four. MRTs must then wait another year for bonuses to be available, making the total deferral two years. In the past, they had to wait five years in total to receive a full bonus.

It's not clear how much lower Citi's new MRT salaries are. In 2024, the average MRT at Citi in London earned a salary of $594k and a bonus of $697k. </news/salaries-and-bonuses-goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-citi-baml-morgan-stanley> Other banks have been able to flex their fixed pay without changing salaries; they paid salaries plus allowances  </news/london-bankers-bigger-bonuses-are-fraught-with-complexity>whereas Citi did not.

Below MRT level, Citi insiders say salary increases were haphazard, as were bonuses. One Citi insider told us he received no increase at all and a dramatically lower bonus. Another says his salary was up in double digits and that he was told this was to compensate for sub-inflation increases in previous years. 

In investment banking, one Citi MD in London said Citi paid well for those who performed, but that this was dependent upon actual revenues generated rather than pipeline. He observed that many of the recent hires made by Vis Raghavan have joined at a global level, enabling them to be paid according to US norms.

If anyone deserves a larger bonus at Citi this year, it may be Jenny Mai, the bank's Hong Kong-based head of equity derivative sales. Mai wrote on LinkedIn that she increased PnL 900% last year.

Citi declined to comment on Mai's achievement. However, a spokesperson said the bank welcomes changes to remuneration rules for UK Material Risk Takers, including deferral requirements. "These changes allow us to better align our UK MRTs with Citi's broader compensation structure and will help keep our compensation competitive within the UK regulatory landscape," she added.

            <description><![CDATA[While the majority of Jane Street </news/how-to-get-a-job-at-jane-street>'s modern hires come from its expanding internship </news/this-is-what-it-takes-to-get-a-64k-jane-street-internship> and graduate </news/the-20-universities-jane-street-loves-most-for-its-quants-and-engineers> programs, some of its traders had far more unusual routes in. Thomas Uhm </news/2022/10/jane-street-trader-sets-out-crypto-roadmap>, joined the firm aged 30 and spent 22 years there before leaving last year; he recently reflected on his time there via X. <https://x.com/ThomasUhm/status/2008509689827377347?s=20>

Uhm said he "often felt out of place" at Jane Street because he lacked the "background or skillset" of his colleagues </news/jane-street-s-traders-on-1-4m-have-fighter-pilot-eyes-high-pain-thresholds>. He spent his 20s pursuing a career as an actor in New York before joining Jane Street's New York office (initially as a clerk, according to a previous appearance on the FTX Podcast <https://youtu.be/y1WA4gbOZUE?si=3fDhP86YsWp4FDzY&t=463>). He said on that podcast that he spent most of his Jane Street career "surfing the wave" and taking interesting opportunities as they arose. One opportunity was joining Jane Street's London office as it was being built. Another was leading its initial push into crypto in 2017.

Since the collapse of FTX  </news/2023/11/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fallout>and demise of its Jane Street alumni founders </news/2023/10/jane-street-interview-process-sam-bankman-fried>, Jane Street has been less bullish on crypto. Uhm said on a podcast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk6vxNNB9_c> last year that firm "had to scale back some of the digital asset business in Q2 2023;" he spent his last 18 months at the firm building out its exotic options business which was "very, very different to crypto." He left Jane Street to join the Jito Foundation, a non-profit supporting infrastructure on the Solana blockchain. 

Despite his "imposter syndrome," Uhm said working at Jito helped him learn "that I’m more valuable than I realised, and, what's more, that others see me that way too." The firm describes itself as "extremely lean and relentlessly effective" in its singular current job opening.

Jane Street has been tentatively returning to crypto despite Uhm's departure. It reportedly tripled its crypto trading volumes in 2024 <https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jane-streets-crypto-trading-tripled-last-year>, and was seen hiring </news/jane-street-hired-an-infrastructure-head-from-a-crypto-firm-after-tripling-crypto-trading> from crypto infrastructure firms like Copper last year. It has also been investing in multiple crypto firms like the Kraken exchange <https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hsg-jane-street-among-investors-krakens-september-fundraising-sources-say-2025-10-22/> and infrastructure firm Antithesis.  <https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/12/03/jane-street-leads-usd105m-funding-for-antithesis-a-testing-tool-used-by-ethereum-network>

The hedge fund which is now a family office has vanished its website and publishes no contact details.

Despite this, people find their way there. Kal El Wahab </news/bof-a-s-head-of-linear-rates-trading-resigned-for-a-hedge-fund-before-bonuses>, until recently Bank of America's head of linear rates trading, is understood to be joining BlueCrest. Last year's recruits included Barclays' trading star Ankur Aneja </news/ankur-aneja>. In Asia, we understand that both Jenna Lee from Nomura and Prateek Gupta from Millennium are currently destined for the firm.

The road to BlueCrest probably involves BlueCrest's internal recruiters, making their multiplication a good sign. Last year, BlueCrest added two new senior recruiters to its ranks towards year-end. 

James Whittingham, a self-professed expert in "scaling world class teams," joined in September. Nicola Cooper-Huntley, a former talent acquisition partner at MUFG, joined in November. Both appear focused on non-portfolio manager roles, however.

BlueCrest is a desirable place to work because it is both highly performant and highly paying.  </news/bluecrest-london-pay>Most desirable appears to be its Dubai office, where the high pay comes with low tax. 

The fund is currently embroiled in a battle at the UK's Supreme Court <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/bluecrest-goes-to-uk-supreme-court-in-senior-trader-tax-dispute>, in which it's arguing that its partners who are "members" with salaries, have decision-making responsibilities involving the management of $100m+ pools of capital that should absolve BlueCrest of the need to pay employer's National Insurance contributions.

            <description><![CDATA[Banks and other financial services firms are certainly eager to implement AI </news/how-to-get-a-banking-ai-job>, but it's easier said than done. At Bank of America, implementing NVIDIA </news/2023/05/nvidia-engineering-jobs-jpmorgan>'s AI enterprise software has been a struggle, according to leaked communications reported by Business Insider.  <https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-nvidia-ai-internal-emails-2026-1>

Speaking to NVIDIA executives at a conference late last year, Bank of America reportedly likened itself to a local car mechanic trying to operate a Formula 1 car (which, for reference, is not road legal). An NVIDIA spokesperson said that the deployment of the software has since been completed. BofA also reportedly said that its in-house staff lacked machine learning operations (MLOps) skills. Today, just six openings at Bank of America mention MLOps. 

Elsewhere in finance, sentiment on AI is mixed. The recent release of Claude for Excel, for example, has faced criticism on X over hallucinations and inaccuracy  </news/goldman-sachs-new-ai-trepidation-means-big-compliance-salaries-for-now>when performing complex tasks. Ex-Citadel portfolio manager Brett Caughran <https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettcaughran/details/experience/> said that the technology received poor feedback from his buy-side colleagues and is "still quite far from ready for the institutional use case of 3-statement financial modelling." Michael Yuan <https://x.com/myuan95/status/2016122243516919844?s=20>, an ex-Goldman banker turned AI startup founder, said the technology's approach is "fundamentally flawed" for banking and private equity use cases. An anonymous former hedge fund manager called Claude for Excel a "complete and utter mess." <https://x.com/TechFundies/status/2016214903644881314?s=20> 

The evident flaws haven't stopped large enterprises from using AI to cut headcount. Just today, Amazon announced it was cutting 16,000 jobs today <https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-cuts-16000-jobs-globally-broader-restructuring-2026-01-28/> after its CEO said last year that AI would lead to automation-induced job losses. The layoffs were first revealed to staff from an email sent in error <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2ywzxlxnlo>; perhaps it was scheduled using AI. The technology has been cited by both Citi <https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/citigroup-ceo-jane-fraser-employees-trained-reinvent-themselves-with-ai-before-tech-changes-roles-forever/> and Goldman Sachs <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-14/goldman-sachs-tells-staff-it-plans-to-cut-more-jobs-this-year> when making job cuts in recent months

Bank of America's leaked communications suggest that there will be increased appetite for MLOps specialists in banking, perhaps supplanting traditional DevOps engineers <https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/will-ai-replace-devops-engineers-2b0e23e8f588>. JPMorgan, for example, has ~50 current openings mentioning MLOps, mostly in London and New York. At the high end, a senior MLOps engineer in New York can earn a salary of $260k. However, one AI engineer speaking anonymously via our new forum, The Bubble <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/t/i-m-a-senior-technologist-who-specializes-in-ai-at-a-top-bank-in-america-ask-me-anything-about-ai-in-financial-services-and-i-will-answer-as-best-i-can/3768/23#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20enough%20free%20educational%20content%20where%20this%20is%20unnecessary%20to%20learn%20the%20material.%20However%2C%20for%20those%20hiring%20managers%20who%20arent%20able%20to%20discern%20skills%20and%20rely%20on%20accreditations%2C%20it%20could%20make%20a%20difference%20in%20whether%20you%20are%20considered%20for%20a%20role>, said that some hiring managers in banks "aren't able to discern [AI] skills and rely on accreditations."

            <description><![CDATA[Change is afoot in Citadel's Asian equities business. Bloomberg reported yesterday that Sachin Kewalramani, the hedge fund's </news/finance/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> head of Asian fundamental equities, has disappeared. No reason was given for the exit and Citadel isn't commenting, but people familiar with the issue say Citadel parted ways with him. Kewalramani didn't respond to a request to elaborate, and it's not clear where he's going next.

Despite Kewalramani's vanishing, Citadel is positive about growth in Asia. Drew Gillanders, the man in London </news/citadel-hedge-fund-jobs-london> who runs international equities for the fund reportedly has hiring plans. Bloomberg says Citadel plans to allocate more capital to the business in Asia and that Gillanders has been spending time recruiting in the region.

If you would like to join Gillanders, he said last year that he likes to hire people with "intense curiosity about markets and performance drivers," and that when he interviews he likes to understand how people react during draw-downs.

Citadel built three equities teams in Singapore last year. 2025's hires included Ran Wei from Sylebra Capital, who appeared to run a TMT team. It's also added juniors like Griffith Goh, a former Balyasny </news/2023/10/balyasny-hedge-fund> gaming analyst whose LinkedIn profile says he joined in December.

Kewalramani once worked for Balyasny too. He was the fund's head of Asia for ten years until he was poached by Citadel in March 2021. Balyasny's Asia business is run by Archana Parekh </news/questions-over-role-of-balyasny-s-singapore-superstar-as-she-builds-the-equities-business>, who joined from Millennium in 2022. In 2024 she reportedly had her book trimmed in order to help Stephen Schurr, a senior equities PM at Balyasny with recruiting. Schurr left for Millennium last year. Balyasny might have space for Kewalramani to return.

            <description><![CDATA[Goldman Sachs is big on hiring in Warsaw </news/2017/12/warsaw-banking-jobs>. According to the students union of GSH Warsaw, the city is home to Goldman's largest office in continental Europe <https://www.instagram.com/p/DTkPXRvjWMA/>. Goldman's latest major hire in the region came from one of the earliest adopters of Polish talent in the hedge fund space.

Maciej Wolański has joined Goldman, working on global banking and markets and engineering. He spent the last five years at Point72, where he was most recently the hedge fund's country head for Poland, taking over the role from Rafa Lopez Espinosa who left for Citadel <https://www.hedgeweek.com/citadel-appoints-point72s-lopez-espinosa-as-coo-for-global-equities-division/> last March. 

Wolański held a number of senior roles at Point72, including head of technology for Poland, and head of middle/back office technology. He also previously spent three years at UBS in its Krakow office, working as head of technology for Poland as well as global head of AI and data platforms for investment banking technology.

Wolański is a Point72 Polish veteran. He joined the fund when it was first pushing into Warsaw and was one of the first 60 employees </news/2021/04/point72-warsaw> hired as part of a push to reach a headcount of 150 by 2021. Today, LinkedIn data suggests Point72 employs over 300 people in Poland while the fund's website says it has over 200 people. More hedge funds have since built offices in Poland, including Balyasny </news/another-hedge-fund-opened-a-warsaw-office-for-developer-hires> and Qube Research.  </news/fast-growing-quant-fund-building-new-team-in-low-cost-tech-hub>

Polish offices, predominantly tech </news/how-to-get-a-technology-job-bank> and back office </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking> hubs, have been on the rise in recent years. Last year,  </news/tech-jobs-finance-poland-warsaw>JPMorgan was accused of ousting London tech staff with poor bonuses to replace them with Polish engineers.  This year, </news/cantor-fitzgerald-hiring-warsaw> brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald appears to have opened a new office in Warsaw.

Tom Bashwiner joined Mubadala Capital earlier this month to be an executive director in its strategic partnerships & acquisitions team, based in New York. He joined the private capital firm, a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company, from boutique bank Lazard, where he was a managing director and head of its corporate development team.

Bashwiner spent just two years at Lazard before leaving and had similarly brief stints in the Bank of America and Barclays FIG teams before that.

Leaving a high-paying bank like Lazard </news/lazard-q4-2024> for a less senior role at a sovereign wealth fund </news/2023/05/sovereign-wealth-funds> seems like a relatively risky career move, but it makes sense. Mubadala Capital, which accepts outsider money, has around $30bn in assets under management, and acts like a strikingly modern asset manager like Blackstone: Bloomberg noted last August <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-08-07/abu-dhabi-wealth-funds-face-pressure-to-offer-carried-interest-awards> that Mubadala Capital even pays some of its employees with carried interest </news/what-is-carried-interest>. And while Lazard pays well, it doesn’t pay carried interest levels of well.

Mabadala Capital is growing, too. Semafor reported yesterday <https://www.semafor.com/article/01/27/2026/mubadala-capital-raises-550m-for-debut-co-investment-fund> that the firm had raised a fresh $550m for its first co-investment fund, including from outside investors, far above its $400m target. It's preparing to launch a second co-investment fund as a consequence.

            <description><![CDATA[Chinese New Year is approaching but in Asia, at least, hiring is happening. As we reported last week </news/us-banks-are-big-on-asia-hiring-in-2026>, US banks have big plans for Asian markets this year. And last year, one recruiter says  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/asia-senior-investment-banker-hires-jump-60-survey-shows>senior investment banker hiring in APAC jumped 60%.

As moves commence, some banks in the region have been losing staff in their banking and markets businesses.

At SMBC, for example, we understand that Kyoko Murai, the head of loan origination for South and South East Asia, is no longer there. Similarly, Aaron Chow, a managing director and general manager for the loans business is on gardening leave.

At ANZ, we understand that Herr-Ling Yeo, the bank's head of Global FX and commodities, has left the bank after 15 years. He is thought to be exploring other opportunities. Stuart Smith, the head of commodities at the bank is also thought to be retiring, and G4 rates trader Ed Gibson quit several weeks ago.

SMBC and ANZ declined to comment. 

SMBC has hired multiple people in Asia in recent years, after adding Carsten Stoehr from Credit Suisse as deputy head of APAC in 2024.

ANZ has lost various people from its credit trading business </news/anz-credit-traders-standard-chartered>, including exits to Standard Chartered. Last September, the bank admitted to engaging in "unconscionable conduct" when raising money for the federal government and paid a $240m fine. 

Alongside Herr-Ling Yeo, ANZ's exits include Anshul Sidher <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-10/anz-global-markets-chief-steps-down-amid-bank-overhaul>, the global markets chief who stepped down in September. There is no implication that Yeo, Sidher, or the others who left were involved in wrongdoing, which involved a different area of the business. Instead, it's thought that recent exits might be more related to the expansion of hedge funds in Asia.

            <description><![CDATA[These days, JPMorgan and Citi's investment banking teams are a bit like one big blended family. In the past year, the two banks have swapped all sorts </news/jp-morgan-s-latest-big-citi-hire-might-be-joined-by-more-after-bonuses> of people </news/jpmorgan-to-citi>. And now those people are under pressure to perform.

At JPMorgan, Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/jpmorgan-tells-its-m-a-bankers-do-more-to-close-the-goldman-gap> reports that bankers are being asked to work harder in 2026. Fourth quarter M&A revenues at JPMorgan fell by 2.5% while at Citi they were up 84%. Arch rival Goldman Sachs was top of the global M&A league tables for 2025. JPMorgan, was a lowly third behind Morgan Stanley. Citi was a lowlier fourth.

JPMorgan bankers are therefore being encouraged to put themselves about. Last year, JPMorgan hired 100 new managing directors (MDs). This year, the bank says its senior bankers begun the year by touring clients in Europe and the US. In a pep talk last week, JPMorgan's global heads of banking John Simmons and Filippo Gori told their people to work harder to win back market share.

2026 is therefore shaping up to be a battle for M&A  </news/get-a-job-in-ma>revenues between all four top US banks, but that battle may be particularly intense between the incestuous parties of JPMorgan and Citi. 

Citi's bankers have had their own pep talk  </news/citi-jane-fraser-memo-layoffs>from CEO Jane Fraser, who started the year with a memo extolling them to be out there "competing for the full wallet, and not settling for a secondary role or missed opportunity." This follows previous pepping </news/vis-raghavan-citi-jpmorgan> from head of banking Vis Raghavan, who suggested in 2024 that Citi's bankers were lacking gumption.

As the race heats up and CEOs find themselves feted by bankers touting deals, Citi's people should at least be enthused by their bonuses for 2025. Financial News  <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/citigroup-hikes-bonuses-for-london-dealmakers-by-up-to-15-1388b8ed?mod=topic_news>reports today that they've been paid up by 'up to 15%' and that some people got 20%. Others, however, got nothing. It's not clear where Citi's ex-JPMorgan people featured in this spread. 

Separately, private credit </news/2022/12/private-credit-jobs> woes were a theme of late 2025, and now they're a theme of early 2026.

It emerged <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/apollo-took-loss-on-asset-backed-loan-deemed-protected> yesterday that Apollo has written down a portion of its $170m financing to Amazon aggregator Perch to zero.

And it comes after the FT  <https://www.ft.com/content/8d7a9c3d-8e1c-40be-915c-7118c4946468>reported that private credit investors have attempted to redeem 5% of shares from a $34bn Blue Owl fund.

We've looked at job listings for 13 major investment banks to find which languages are most frequently requested. While we found Python  </news/2021/08/python-for-banking-jobs>to be the most popular language across all areas of finance when we looked at this in September </news/programming-languages-for-a-career-in-finance>, it seems that major banks have a different favourite: SQL.

SQL is the de facto language in finance for data analysis and is used by multiple different types of role. Data scientists, quants, risk managers </news/2020/07/need-to-code-if-work-in-risk-management> and even investment bankers </news/data-science-investment-banking-internship> use it. 

Behind it are Python and Java. Python is the most popular language in the world right now, and is used in all manner of functions, including data analysis and machine learning </news/python-ocaml-jane-street-ai>. Java is banks' historic favourite; jobs with that language more often involve working on legacy or back office technology </news/2021/10/java-17-banks>. There are some exceptionally high paying jobs for Java developers </news/2023/03/low-latency-java-developer> in finance, but they're predominantly found outside of banking, at hedge funds and trading firms.

It's notable that hiring for tech roles in India is greater than the US and UK combined </news/best-coding-language-for-banking-jobs-london-new-york>. Roughly half of all Java </news/2019/03/java-or-python-banking> roles in the banks we looked at are in the subcontinent.

C++ roles </news/finance/c-coding-language-problems>, which can often be some of the highest paying </news/low-latency-c> tech jobs, are proportionally high in Hong Kong and Singapore </news/best-university-for-banking-jobs-hong-kong-singapore>. While ~10% of global banking jobs are in C++, the language is mentioned in roughly a quarter of listings in these Asian cities. 

Roughly 9% of tech candidates in our CV database claim C++ experience. The incidence of C++ jobs is therefore 1.2x times higher than the incidence of C++ candidates. C++ is an outlier compared to the likes of Python, SQL and Java which have huge candidate bases; almost 50% of candidates have SQL experience.

At all but two banks, Java roles made up 20% to 23% of total openings. More niche languages are less equally distributed. 

For example, Q,  </news/should-you-learn-the-obtuse-niche-language-paying-700k-in-finance>another high-paying niche language, is particularly popular at Goldman Sachs. It makes up 2.8% of job listings at the bank compared to just 1% at JPMorgan and 0.5% at HSBC.

Bank of America isn't commenting, but multiple associates in the investment bank tell us their bonuses were ok for last year, but were not the best. The disappointment is most acute when 2025 bonuses are juxtaposed with what associates were earning a few years ago. 

"Top-ranked people got bonuses that were 75% of salaries," says one associate at the bank in London who purports to have canvassed colleagues. "A few years ago, it was more like 110%."

Another BofA associate in the investment bank in Europe says associate bonuses there this year vary between $25k and $120k and that sentiment is "mixed." "Expectations were strong after a strong year, but on balance it is ok," he says.

When combined with associate salaries of $160k, this year's bonuses mean BofA's top-performing associates are earning total compensation of $280k.

Their lack of excitement about this isn't just due to the historically diminished bonuses, but to deferrals. "75% of base is not very exciting once you take into account that 30% of the bonus is paid in stock vested over four years," says one associate. 

Disgruntled people can always move. "There will be more jobs this year, the market is opening up," says one junior, hopefully. "Hiring will be slower because of AI, but banks still need to train future MDs," he also adds. 

Logan Naidu, CEO of Kernel Global says early indications are that this was a down round for associate bonuses in the UK. In the US, though, bonuses across the market seem to be higher. Meridith Dennes at New York search firm Prospect Rock Partners says bonuses there are up 28% to 42% this year.

As a result, Dennes says associates two and three in the US are earning between $333k and $380k (2) and $370k and $418k (3).

            <title>What is carried interest? (And why do you want it?)</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/what-is-carried-interest</link>

            <description><![CDATA[For a long time, the big appeal to working in private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> was the prospect of a big carried interest payout. But what exactly is carried interest? Why does everyone want it? And does it still exist?

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community.  <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/login?_gl=1*ut8n6u*_gcl_au*MTg4MDY2NTExNi4xNzYxNTU3NDIz*_ga*ODczNzI2NTA0LjE3NTM2OTk2ODI.*_ga_NZFQV4MXPM*czE3NjM2NDM0MDYkbzI1NiRnMSR0MTc2MzY0MzQzOSRqMjckbDAkaDMyMjc4OTUzMw..>✍️

The simple version is that carried interest is a percentage of a successfully exited private equity deal paid out to the people in the private equity firm who worked on it.

However, there's a more complicated version too. 

Private equity firms go into deals with outside investors. In those deals, the passive investors – pension funds and ultra-high net worth individuals and the likes – are known as Limited Partners (LPs), and the private equity funds are known as General Partners (GPs).

GPs, after raising money from LPs, go shopping with the money they’ve raised. They identify a good potential target company which is private and purchase it. They spend a few years “improving” it (this is contentious, but a story for another time) and then sell it again, either to the public markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> via an IPO or to another company that is looking to expand as a bolt-on M&A deal </news/what-are-ma-jobs>.

Once the deal is exited, the private equity firm has (hopefully) made a profit. Before it began the deal, it negotiated a benchmark, known as a hurdle rate, with its LPs. This hurdle rate is a rate of return at which the GP can actually begin to pay itself – everything below that belongs to the LPs.

Once the hurdle rate (usually around 7%) – is hit in a deal, a GP begins to allocate payments in the form of carried interest to the staff that worked on it. Depending on seniority, this can hit some mind-boggling figures – recruitment consultancy One Search </news/private-equity-pay-london> said last year that London-based PE partners can take up more than 10% of a carried interest fee pool after a successful deal, cashing out more than $25m in personal compensation. Even VPs on the deal can expect 2-4% of the pool and earn more than $1m in compensation. Heidrick & Struggles noted <https://www.heidrick.com/-/media/heidrickcom/publications-and-reports/2025-europe-private-capital-compensation-survey.pdf?rev=a5fa543d2f0b4da99b5e5385a83e37c1> last month that carried interest could still accumulate to €32m ($38m) for managing partners at the biggest firms, while even principals (VP/Director equivalents </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds>) could expect between €1.1m ($1.4m) and €5.2m ($6.3m) in carried interest depending on fund size.

On top of the huge pay packages, carried interested has usually enjoyed a favourable tax regime compared to other compensation methods. In the USA, it's taxed at capital gains rates (up to 20%) as opposed to income rates (up to 37%). The UK has enjoyed a similarly beneficial tax rate (up to 28%) which is due to end in April this year, when the tax rate will go up to 34%.

So, what’s the problem? 

Private equity (PE) as an industry has not been doing well recently. Higher interest rates mean funds are not as easy to raise <https://www.wellington.com/en/insights/impact-of-higher-interest-rates-on-private-equity> as they used to be. It’s also become difficult for PE firms to exit their deals at a profit. S&P Global <https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/10/private-equity-exit-count-grew-in-q3-as-transaction-sizes-shrank-93889635> said that IPOs and "trade" (M&A) sell-ons were at the lowest levels they've been in years, at around $33.5bn in Q3 of 2025, compared to a $242bn peak in Q2 2022.

As a result, many PE firms are turning to the secondaries market </news/private-capital-advisory-jobs-investment-banking>, where firms sell their stakes in an investment to each other - a kind of financial game of hot potato. S&P Global said last October that secondaries had their largest market share since at least 2021 in Q3 of 2025. Secondaries are a relatively new way of discarding assets, and probably not sustainable – hot potato is not a game about holding onto the potato for as long as possible, after all.

The lack of real exit options is biting the industry. Back in November </news/andy-sieg-wealth-citi>, private equity professionals admitted to the Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/finance/the-golden-handcuffs-are-off-private-equity-employees-leave-for-smaller-firms-375573c6?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos2> that they were downsizing their expectations for theoretical windfalls that might not materialize, and were more concerned with paying their kids’ private school tuition than with private jets.

It’s important to note that carried interest isn’t the primary way that private equity firms make money. Like other asset management firms, they charge investors a percentage of their assets under management (AuM) as a fee (around 2%). They also charge a management fee to the companies that they manage. 

Likewise, carried interest isn't the only aspect of private equity compensation - and according to our compensation report </banking-compensation-guide> last year, private equity salaries and bonuses are roughly on par with investment banking already.

Carried interest and AuM management fees are also charged in private credit deals. These have grown in popularity since the financial crisis, but have questions are now being raised over some private credit investments. For example, a series of loans to e-commerce aggregators have led to some brutal write-downs in recent years. Bloomberg reported yesterday <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/apollo-took-loss-on-asset-backed-loan-deemed-protected?srnd=phx-markets> that Apollo wrote down a portion of its $170m financing to Perch, an Amazon brand aggregator, by 100%.

            <description><![CDATA[For a long time, the big appeal to working in private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> was the prospect of a big carried interest payout. But what exactly is carried interest? Why does everyone want it? And does it still exist?

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community.  <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/login?_gl=1*ut8n6u*_gcl_au*MTg4MDY2NTExNi4xNzYxNTU3NDIz*_ga*ODczNzI2NTA0LjE3NTM2OTk2ODI.*_ga_NZFQV4MXPM*czE3NjM2NDM0MDYkbzI1NiRnMSR0MTc2MzY0MzQzOSRqMjckbDAkaDMyMjc4OTUzMw..>✍️

The simple version is that carried interest is a percentage of a successfully exited private equity deal paid out to the people in the private equity firm who worked on it.

However, there's a more complicated version too. 

Private equity firms go into deals with outside investors. In those deals, the passive investors – pension funds and ultra-high net worth individuals and the likes – are known as Limited Partners (LPs), and the private equity funds are known as General Partners (GPs).

GPs, after raising money from LPs, go shopping with the money they’ve raised. They identify a good potential target company which is private and purchase it. They spend a few years “improving” it (this is contentious, but a story for another time) and then sell it again, either to the public markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> via an IPO or to another company that is looking to expand as a bolt-on M&A deal </news/what-are-ma-jobs>.

Once the deal is exited, the private equity firm has (hopefully) made a profit. Before it began the deal, it negotiated a benchmark, known as a hurdle rate, with its LPs. This hurdle rate is a rate of return at which the GP can actually begin to pay itself – everything below that belongs to the LPs.

Once the hurdle rate (usually around 7%) – is hit in a deal, a GP begins to allocate payments in the form of carried interest to the staff that worked on it. Depending on seniority, this can hit some mind-boggling figures – recruitment consultancy One Search </news/private-equity-pay-london> said last year that London-based PE partners can take up more than 10% of a carried interest fee pool after a successful deal, cashing out more than $25m in personal compensation. Even VPs on the deal can expect 2-4% of the pool and earn more than $1m in compensation. Heidrick & Struggles noted <https://www.heidrick.com/-/media/heidrickcom/publications-and-reports/2025-europe-private-capital-compensation-survey.pdf?rev=a5fa543d2f0b4da99b5e5385a83e37c1> last month that carried interest could still accumulate to €32m ($38m) for managing partners at the biggest firms, while even principals (VP/Director equivalents </news/banks-weird-hierarchies-analysts-associates-vps-mds>) could expect between €1.1m ($1.4m) and €5.2m ($6.3m) in carried interest depending on fund size.

On top of the huge pay packages, carried interested has usually enjoyed a favourable tax regime compared to other compensation methods. In the USA, it's taxed at capital gains rates (up to 20%) as opposed to income rates (up to 37%). The UK has enjoyed a similarly beneficial tax rate (up to 28%) which is due to end in April this year, when the tax rate will go up to 34%.

So, what’s the problem? 

Private equity (PE) as an industry has not been doing well recently. Higher interest rates mean funds are not as easy to raise <https://www.wellington.com/en/insights/impact-of-higher-interest-rates-on-private-equity> as they used to be. It’s also become difficult for PE firms to exit their deals at a profit. S&P Global <https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/10/private-equity-exit-count-grew-in-q3-as-transaction-sizes-shrank-93889635> said that IPOs and "trade" (M&A) sell-ons were at the lowest levels they've been in years, at around $33.5bn in Q3 of 2025, compared to a $242bn peak in Q2 2022.

As a result, many PE firms are turning to the secondaries market </news/private-capital-advisory-jobs-investment-banking>, where firms sell their stakes in an investment to each other - a kind of financial game of hot potato. S&P Global said last October that secondaries had their largest market share since at least 2021 in Q3 of 2025. Secondaries are a relatively new way of discarding assets, and probably not sustainable – hot potato is not a game about holding onto the potato for as long as possible, after all.

The lack of real exit options is biting the industry. Back in November </news/andy-sieg-wealth-citi>, private equity professionals admitted to the Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/finance/the-golden-handcuffs-are-off-private-equity-employees-leave-for-smaller-firms-375573c6?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos2> that they were downsizing their expectations for theoretical windfalls that might not materialize, and were more concerned with paying their kids’ private school tuition than with private jets.

It’s important to note that carried interest isn’t the primary way that private equity firms make money. Like other asset management firms, they charge investors a percentage of their assets under management (AuM) as a fee (around 2%). They also charge a management fee to the companies that they manage. 

Likewise, carried interest isn't the only aspect of private equity compensation - and according to our compensation report </banking-compensation-guide> last year, private equity salaries and bonuses are roughly on par with investment banking already.

Carried interest and AuM management fees are also charged in private credit deals. These have grown in popularity since the financial crisis, but have questions are now being raised over some private credit investments. For example, a series of loans to e-commerce aggregators have led to some brutal write-downs in recent years. Bloomberg reported yesterday <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/apollo-took-loss-on-asset-backed-loan-deemed-protected?srnd=phx-markets> that Apollo wrote down a portion of its $170m financing to Perch, an Amazon brand aggregator, by 100%.

            <title>UBS bonuses are this Thursday. There are comings &amp; goings before they&#39;re announced</title>

            <description><![CDATA[US banks have announced their bonuses  </news/bank-of-america-bonuses-are-out-they-may-be-moderately-good>already. Now, it's European banks' turn. UBS will go first, announcing its bonuses on January 29th (Thursday). However, the Swiss banks' insiders have mixed opinions about the imminent bonuses' likely size, and there have been some curious arrivals and departures ahead of time in the rates business.

UBS isn't commenting, but prognoses for the bank's bonus pool vary from down 10-15% globally, to up 3-5% in some support functions and up 10-15% in investment banking. All are below the 29% increase in bonuses apparently </news/bonus-expectations-by-bank> anticipated by UBS people before Christmas. 

Last year </news/ubs-bonuses>, UBS increased its overall bonus pool by 4% and raised its average key risk-taker bonus by 27%. This year, people at the investment bank are optimistic after integration costs fell 61% year-on-year to $211m and profits rose 52% to $2,2bn in the first nine months of 2025.  

UBS's investment bankers are particularly excited. "The market is up and they will have to pay competitively," explains one MD in London.

In trading, insiders point to changes in UBS's London rates trading team before bonuses are announced. Kilian Frensch </news/kilian-frensch>, the friendly ex-Nomura ex-Deutsche Bank rates trader turned up yesterday, while George Dramitinos, a London-based rates trader who joined from Brevan Howard in late 2023, seems to have disappeared. Jason Colloupas, an Australian market trader in London is also thought to have gone. 

At the same time, and unrelated to bonuses, UBS has been hiring new people in. Yumin Wang, a rates salesperson, joined in December. Both Wang and Frensch previously worked for Credit Suisse with UBS's top macro trader Shane O’Cuinn, but O'Cuinn is understood to have hired four other traders with whom he did not have prior relations.

Last year, Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/ubs-plans-january-job-cuts-to-kick-off-final-year-of-integration?embedded-checkout=true> said UBS was planning another round of job cuts </news/ubs-layoffs-credit-suisse> in January. However, Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/europe-investment-bank-bosses-stay-cautious-on-hiring-even-as-2026-boom-predicted-51905b8b?mod=homepage> also reported that it plans to hire bankers this year.

            <description><![CDATA[In recent years, a tug of war has developed between prominent electronic trading firms </news/best-electronic-trading-for-to-work-for> and AI laboratories for talent. Last year, OpenAI was reportedly offering junior quants $3m compensation packages </news/openai-culture>, and other labs like Anthropic were hosting dinners to tempt high-frequency trading </news/high-frequency-trading-hiring-and-pay> quants </news/quant-jobs-finance> to make the switch. If you're considering a move, an ex-Citadel Securities  </news/citadel-securities-vs-jane-street>quant has revealed just how different AI research jobs are.

Nimit Sohoni spent two years as a quant at Citadel Securities, joining as a graduate after completing his PhD. </news/do-you-need-a-phd-for-a-quant-job-in-finance> He's spent the last two years at Cartesia, a voice AI firm. Appearing on a podcast  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jECS37M3dQ>yesterday, he explained the differences between is current job and his time at Citadel Securities. 

For one, he said quants in finance work far fewer hours than researchers in AI. In finance, Sohoni said he had "a pretty great life balance, as funny as that might sound."  Sohoni said his finance colleagues were "really clustered working around trading hours and don't take their work home all too much." This was confirmed last year by ex-Jane Street engineer Leila Clark </news/jane-street-pay-hourly>, who said Jane Street staff work nine-hour days on average. 

It's not like that in AI. Sohoni said the AI space includes "a lot of people who are working around the clock." Competition for positions is high and "you can gain a comparative advantage just by outworking your competition." Ex-quants in AI have told us  </news/chatgpt-openai-culture>that the long hours aren't mandatory, but researchers choose to work late out of passion.

There are advantages, though. Sohoni said AI labs have far more open cultures, to the point that it was "jarring" for him to hear colleagues speak so openly about their projects. In finance, by contrast, "a lot of people are reluctant or even forbidden to talk about any details of what they do."  Culture differs between the big and small AI labs, however. Sohoni said that the larger firms like OpenAI have massive compute power, but "can be more averse to out-of-the-box ideas and more susceptible to groupthink."

Both AI and finance pay well. Sohoni said the two offer the potential to earn "NBA salaries." In quant finance, however, pay is "not exactly outlandish" and outperformance is difficult to achieve. "Hard metrics [mean] that it's easier to evaluate how somebody does, especially if you're an alpha quant."

He said finance quant careers can become "U-shaped" as a result. Seniority comes with higher pay, but the quality of your alpha can't always keep up. "Even a good quant can stop being worth it after a while," he said, "whereas early career quants </news/high-frequency-trading-internship> might be very good and also not command as much of a salary." AI labs seem to have much more reverence for their senior staff; according to Levels.fyi <https://www.levels.fyi/2025/>, OpenAI is the second-highest paying firm in the world for staff engineers, and fifth-highest for principal engineers.

            <description><![CDATA[Hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> SurgoCap Partners made the news recently for its assets under management (AuM) reaching $6bn. The most remarkable part of its story, however, is how few people it reached that point with.

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community.  <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/login?_gl=1*ut8n6u*_gcl_au*MTg4MDY2NTExNi4xNzYxNTU3NDIz*_ga*ODczNzI2NTA0LjE3NTM2OTk2ODI.*_ga_NZFQV4MXPM*czE3NjM2NDM0MDYkbzI1NiRnMSR0MTc2MzY0MzQzOSRqMjckbDAkaDMyMjc4OTUzMw..>✍️

SurgoCap, which was founded by Mala Gaonkar – a rare female hedge fund chief – employed just 24 people, according to its latest form ADV, a US regulatory disclosure. It’s a remarkably efficient firm, and it’s a rare example of a lean hedge fund in an industry generally pushing towards institutionalisation. 

Egerton Capital is another. The London-based fund, which was founded in 1994, has around $19.1bn in AuM, and proudly says on its website that it also only has a 13-person investment team. Public disclosures from its subsidiary that appears to employ most people, Egerton Capital Limited, showed 20 total employees for the year ending March 2025.

The Children’s Investment (TCI) Fund Management is another big (pun intended) one. With some $70bn in assets under management, the London-based fund, which was founded and is still run by spiritualist </news/chris-hohn> Chris Hohn, has just fifty employees in total, according to its most recent public filings.

The funds above have over $100bn in total assets under management, with a collective 100 or so employees, averaging $1bn in managed assets per employee. It’s vastly more than their multi-strategy rivals </news/big-multistrategy-hedge-funds>, the biggest of which, Millennium and Citadel, employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 employees respectively to manage smaller assets. The two firms averaged around $13m and $20m in assets per employee across 2025.

Working for one of these tiny hedge funds brings benefits. Being so small, you're likely in the same room as someone making massive investment decisions on a daily basis - something likely to be a much rarer occurrence in a Millennium- or Citadel-sized fund. Mentorship and networking are easy access. And not to mention that a smaller team means there are less mouths to feed - and more bonus money to go around.

            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/vxhJWfcWQHGjbnqOqT2P" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[Not so long ago, Andy Sieg at Citi seemed to have put complaints  </news/andy-sieg-investigation>by various senior female employees </news/andy-sieg-citi-complaints-exits> behind him. He was focused on getting on with his new and bigger job </news/andy-sieg-wealth-citi> while repeating the mantra that "change is hard" </news/andy-sieg-citi-sarcasm> and talking about growth stories <https://www.instagram.com/reels/DT0nvHqCJBC/> at Davos. Yesterday, however, a new Sieg-related lawsuit was filed, and it seems more peculiar than the complaints preceding it.

The Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/6b539d0f-d469-40ad-a967-5d712221038a> reported that Julia Carreon, who was Citi Wealth’s global head of platform and experience until 2024, has filed a lawsuit in which she says Citi wrongly claimed that she had an inappropriate relationship with Sieg while she worked there. 

Citi says Carreon's lawsuit has "absolutely no merit" and that it will be demonstrating this "through legal process." 

Whereas earlier complaints about Sieg - which Citi insists <https://www.ft.com/content/be4ab80a-40f8-4cb2-81a3-cde101b5fa7a> it thoroughly investigated - focused on his alleged hard-charging approach </news/andy-sieg-citi-sarcasm>, Carreon's suit portrays an isolated individual at the top of one of Citi's most challenging businesses who, she claims, called and texted her multiple times a week - sometimes from a burner phone - because he had no one to talk to. 

Carreon says she wasn't having a relationship with Sieg, but claims that Sieg insinuated that they were. She says Sieg's insinuations included claiming that they shared a "secret song." The song is not divulged. 

When Carreon and Sieg's alleged closeness was discerned by Citi and by colleagues, who the Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/former-citi-executive-sues-bank-alleging-sexual-harassment-bbf6b5b0?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqel9G1N8VrsH00UzPXa-AOGMNsomKj0Wtl-UjBnejHyjUd-3aplDYYy4K1fehk%3D&gaa_ts=697890f3&gaa_sig=xqDAh-tswhRGNWXSogdhZinMNhiPgw9zmiFkKNcOsGkL00eIUctOiX4VzR7I50r5ic12D1kp7xNvFgfQsSz4LA%3D%3D> says assumed that she was having an affair with Sieg, Carreon says the bank conducted an investigation. She says this was biased against her and that the HR team sided with Sieg. In her complaint filed yesterday, she accuses the bank of having a “discriminatory and sexually harassing culture.” Citi denies this. 

As Business Insider  <https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-executives-jane-fraser-raghavan-sieg-ryan-2026-1>observed this week, Sieg is one of Citi CEO Jane Fraser's prize hires. Fraser said in September </news/andy-sieg-wealth-citi> that the bank "looked at the matter seriously" when earlier complaints were made about him, and concluded that they were invalid. Sieg was tasked with cutting costs and restructuring </news/Andy-Sieg-Citi> the wealth business, where revenues have increased 22% in the past two years. Fraser said last September that Sieg had "delivered" on his mandate and that she was very pleased with both he and his team. 

Separately, Sina Lashgari and Jon Paul </news/2022/08/highest-paying-jobs-at-goldman-sachs> seemed to be having a fine time at Goldman Sachs, where their 20-person program trading team made $700m a year for two years to 2022 and an unnamed individual received a $9m bonus. 

Like many talented traders, the two decided to move to a hedge fund. </news/finance/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> Unfortunately, the move seems to have been fraught from the start. First, Goldman accused them of, "accessing sensitive Firm proprietary computer software...without authorization or a valid business purpose, and attempting to remove or hide evidence." Now, Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/verition-shutters-team-led-by-ex-goldman-traders-lashgari-paul?srnd=phx-industries-finance>reports that Verition has closed their team three years after they joined.

The reason for the closure is unclear, but Bloomberg suggests it was down to the poor performance of some event-driven bets. Lashgari didn't respond to a request to comment.

Some Verition insiders have described the fund </news/2023/05/verition-hedge-fund> as being run by "really nice people" and having a fine culture. Others have told us that the London office is very nice and has good snacks. However, like all hedge funds, Verition has a limited tolerance for drawdowns.  </news/hedge-fund-interviews>It is also not unfamiliar with hiring good people and letting them go again - Sara Nainzadeh </news/hedge-fund-verition-s-top-hire-from-millennium-appears-to-have-left-again>, who spent 20 years at Milllennium, came and went within a year or so.

Meanwhile...

            <description><![CDATA[I'm a trader at Goldman Sachs. My bonus this year was good but not great. It's a perpetual reminder that I am making money for the machine.

Despite this, I have no intention of leaving. I see plenty of colleagues going to places like Jane Street, Optiver or Citadel Securities,  </news/2022/10/how-to-get-a-job-at-citadel>but I think it's a significant risk. Market makers are a good bet when you're 22 years old, but when you're in your 30s, I think they're a mistake. It seems to me that the median age there is incredibly low, and it can be very difficult to survive. It's worth taking the risk if you're a fresh graduate, but dangerous beyond that.

I say this based only on personal observation. I've seen friends go to market makers, and they've either been paid terribly or have left quickly. Yes, you're working for the machine at Goldman, but in my opinion it's even worse at market making firms. You have very little ownership and in my opinion the culture can be ruthless, as it can be elsewhere. They also skew pay very highly towards top-performers and the median can be low. I've got friends who've joined these firms and then worked 15 hours a day just to learn the systems.

By comparison, my job at Goldman Sachs seems relatively safe. I'm in a management role and am well-respected. Working for Goldman Sachs seems a steady long-term career. The firm is a top market leader in my area and we have an edge. It makes far more sense for me to stay here than to jump to a trading firm for a high bonus that probably won't materialise and that - if it does - will simply increase the risk that I'm cut the next time there are layoffs.

Charles Holive is joining BNP Paribas as an MD and chief AI officer for its corporate and institutional bank (CIB), home to its markets  </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm>and advisory </news/get-a-job-in-ma> teams. He joins after an 18-month stint at PepsiCo, where he was SVP of AI solutions.

It's a return to banking for Holive. Before PepsiCo, he spent three years at JPMorgan as an MD. There, he joined as head of CIB applied AI and machine learning (ML) operations, before becoming head of AI/ML and digital tools services for the division.

BNP Paribas has been developing various AI products in its CIB. Last month, it rolled out an AI tool for bankers <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/bnp-paribas-rolls-out-ai-portal-to-cut-pitch-time-for-dealmakers-8453517a> to analyze previous pitch data, while older AI tools have focused on analyzing the ESG performance  <https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/46894/bnp-paribas-deploys-ai-to-speed-up-esg-assessments>of companies.

As a French bank, BNP is big on Mistral, the French AI lab that created the very on-the-nose French chatbot 'Le Chat'. The bank signed a deal in 2024 <https://group.bnpparibas/en/press-release/bnp-paribas-and-mistral-ai-sign-a-partnership-agreement-covering-all-mistral-ai-models> giving it access to current and future Mistral large language models. Insiders suggest that Mistral LLMs aren't universally popular among employees, however.

BNP Paribas did not respond to a request for comment.

            <description><![CDATA[As we note in Morning Coffee </news/david-solomon-goldman-sachs-pay> today, 2026 stands to be a big year for hedge funds </news/finance/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job>. Goldman Sachs' recent hedge fund survey found that investors plan to allocate money to hedge funds this year than at any point since 2017. More money typically means more staff.

However, that money will not be allocated equally. As the chart below, from Goldman's presentation based on the survey, shows, allocators are most keen on allocating money to quant funds and equity long/short funds in 2026. By implication, this is where the hiring will be strongest. 

By comparison, credit funds have fallen out of favour. Multistrategy funds are still popular, but less so than during the heyday of 2023.

            <description><![CDATA[JPMorgan </news/jpmorgan-pay-executives> spends a lot of money on tech. According to its 2025 investor day, the bank budgeted $18bn </news/jp-morgan-s-18bn-tech-spending-suggests-these-developers-are-in-high-demand> for technology. It ended the year with a non-compensation technology expense of $11bn according to its Q4 results, which implies a lot has been set aside for engineering pay.

The bank's technology team is rapidly expanding, accounting for over 1,000 of its 7,000+ current job openings, but how much can you expect to make if you get in?

How much are engineering analysts, associates and VPs paid at JPMorgan?

Using self-reported compensation numbers posted to Levels.fyi <https://www.levels.fyi/en-gb/companies/jpmorgan-chase/salaries> since the start of 2025, we've analyzed over 1,200 datapoints to calculate average total compensation figures at each level of seniority at JPMorgan.

The US naturally pays the most at each level of seniority, with the UK lagging slightly behind. There is a big disparity between pay in those two regions and the bank's global capacity centres (GCCs) in India </news/h1b-visa-investment-banking-jos>; pay for Indian engineering analysts is just $23.5k on average compared to $61k in the UK and $108k in the US.

From analyst to associate, the UK has the largest average rise in pay. Total compensation increases by over 70% to $105k. Pay for Indian engineers increases by ~50% while the pay increase for US associates is closer to 35%. 

The US, similarly, has the smallest pay increase for VPs. Pay for UK engineers at JPMorgan rises over 70% again from associate to VP while pay in India almost doubles to $71k.

At executive director level, pay in each seniority rises massively. JPMorgan pays US-based EDs the most, $348k on average, but Indian engineers once again had the largest pay increase, more than doubling compensation to an average of $144k at ED level.

Which types of engineers earn the most at JPMorgan

Levels.fyi also breaks down the engineering divisions of its datapoints. When looking at global average figures for a number of its most prominent divisions, it may come as no surprise to see what pays the most.

AI engineers at JPMorgan earn an average of $207k. In New York, they can earn much more; one VP reported a total compensation of $400k with a salary of $260k, while another earned a total of $300k. For some of its most unique AI roles, JPMorgan offers up to $325k in salary alone. </news/jp-morgan-paying-325k-salaries-for-its-new-ai-strike-team>

The lowest paying division, by contrast, is full-stack. This is in part because these roles are much more common in its lower paying offices. Pay for US full-stack engineers was $146k, with pay reaching as high as $440k for one Texas-based full-stack executive director.

People at the bank are being informed of their numbers moment by moment. It's too early to say exactly what they're like, but the vibe seems moderately good. Bank of America is not commenting.

In markets, sources say BofA's bonuses are "ok." The pool is up, but only by a small amount. There's more differentiation between strong and poor performers. One London insider confirmed that they are "moderate." Asian bonuses at BofA are thought to be strong relative to the US and EMEA.

In investment banking, where Reuters <https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/bofa-bonuses-will-jump-investment-bankers-this-year-sources-say-2025-12-19/> suggested in December that BofA's bonus pool was up 20% on last year, people may be more pleased, although we cannot confirm that this has come to pass.

Pre-Christmas, BofA people told us </news/bonus-expectations-by-bank> they were expecting a wild 59% increase in their bonuses. This seems unlikely.

Bank of America's global markets team generated record revenues last year. However, the bank is squeezing compensation costs as it throttles hiring  </news/banking-recruitment-s-sorry-story-more-candidates-fewer-jobs>and tries to do more with AI. "Headcount remains our key driver of expense from compensation and benefits to real estate and technology," said CFO Alastair Borthwick, speaking during the bank's fourth quarter investor call. 

In a seeming vote against bonuses, Bank of America lost Kal El Wahab </news/bof-a-s-head-of-linear-rates-trading-resigned-for-a-hedge-fund-before-bonuses>, its EMEA head of linear rates trading, to Bluecrest </news/what-s-it-like-to-work-for-mike-platt-at-blue-crest-capital-management> in Dubai earlier this month. Speaking to Semafor <https://www.semafor.com/article/01/23/2026/bank-of-americas-brian-moynihan-the-pipelines-are-full> at Davos, CEO Brian Moynihan said investment banking pipelines are full but that although regulations are lifting, "the real best time to be a banker is when the economy’s decent."

Profits in BofA's markets business rose 9% last year. In global banking, which includes corporate and investment banking, they were down 2%.

At Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley </news/goldman-sachs-and-morgan-stanley-people-complain-of-poor-bonuses-away-from-the-front-office>, people appear to have been paid well in the front office but not so well elsewhere.

At JPMorgan, Jose will be a managing director running the risk trading desk of JPMorgan's program trading team. Program trading is a potentially lucrative type of trading in which you algorithmically predict </news/algorithmic-trading-jobs-in-banking> which stocks will be added or removed from an ETF during a period of index rebalancing. 

Jose, an Eton and Cambridge graduate, was latterly EMEA head of program trading at Goldman Sachs, having made MD in 2021. </news/2021/11/goldman-sachs-mds-europe>  Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-01/goldman-lost-2-traders-then-accused-them-of-accessing-secret-code> reported in 2022 that the program trading team at Goldman Sachs generated $1.4bn in a two-year period with a headcount of just 20. 

Other Goldman program traders have gone on to big things; Anne-Victoire Auriault <https://www.efinancialcareers.fr/actu/2020/11/lirresistible-ascension-dune-francaise-de-32-ans-promue-partner-chez-goldman-sachs?_ga=2.158873274.1092697541.1659266760-609851753.1655882981&_gl=1*1agqvsr*_gcl_au*MTQwNzM0MDU3Mi4xNzYxODE4OTg1> made partner aged just 32 by heading the program trading desk in New York.

            <description><![CDATA[Not all people who leave banks for hedge funds </news/best-paying-hedge-funds> stay there. In 2024 John Jose left Goldman Sachs and joined Millennium </news/millennium-hedge-fund-pay-london> as a senior equities <https://www.investmentnews.com/independent-broker-dealers/goldman-sachs-loses-another-long-term-senior-leader/252080> portfolio manager.

At JPMorgan, Jose will be a managing director running the risk trading desk of JPMorgan's program trading team. Program trading is a potentially lucrative type of trading in which you algorithmically predict </news/algorithmic-trading-jobs-in-banking> which stocks will be added or removed from an ETF during a period of index rebalancing. 

Jose, an Eton and Cambridge graduate, was latterly EMEA head of program trading at Goldman Sachs, having made MD in 2021. </news/2021/11/goldman-sachs-mds-europe>  Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-01/goldman-lost-2-traders-then-accused-them-of-accessing-secret-code> reported in 2022 that the program trading team at Goldman Sachs generated $1.4bn in a two-year period with a headcount of just 20. 

Other Goldman program traders have gone on to big things; Anne-Victoire Auriault <https://www.efinancialcareers.fr/actu/2020/11/lirresistible-ascension-dune-francaise-de-32-ans-promue-partner-chez-goldman-sachs?_ga=2.158873274.1092697541.1659266760-609851753.1655882981&_gl=1*1agqvsr*_gcl_au*MTQwNzM0MDU3Mi4xNzYxODE4OTg1> made partner aged just 32 by heading the program trading desk in New York.

Cantor Fitzgerald is hiring in Poland </news/tech-jobs-finance-poland-warsaw>.

The brokerage firm is looking for nine new staff in Warsaw, working across operations </news/operations-jobs-banking>, finance </news/accounting-job-finance-banking>, compliance </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-compliance>, and technology </news/how-to-get-a-technology-job-bank>, of course. The vacancies are for international support roles, with a senior tax role noting that it requires liaising with offices in the UK, EMEA, and APAC.

Cantor Fitzgerald’s website does not mention a presence in Poland at all. The jobs may be the start of a new office there. 

Warsaw is a popular option for nearshoring, with investment banks like Goldman Sachs </news/2017/12/warsaw-banking-jobs> and JPMorgan <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/jpmorgan-confirms-plans-for-3000-new-staff-in-warsaw-20170926> already heavily invested in the city, as well as hedge funds such as Point72 </news/2021/04/point72-warsaw> and Balyasny </news/another-hedge-fund-opened-a-warsaw-office-for-developer-hires>.

UBS has a huge presence down the road in Krakow, some 5,000 people. BNY Mellon has its own massive presence in Wroclaw – around 3,000. Morgan Stanley has a 3,000-strong Budapest office.

            <title>Morning Coffee: How to earn $47m at Goldman Sachs. Hedge fund hiring is only going to intensify </title>

            <description><![CDATA[For a brief moment last week, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, may have felt rich. Dimon found out on Thursday that he earned $43m for 2025, which was 10% more than the previous year and more than all his JPMorgan executive colleagues.  </news/jpmorgan-pay-executives>But then David Solomon </news/david-solomon-goldman-sachs-wrath> came along.

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

David Solomon, who is CEO of Goldman Sachs </news/how-to-get-a-job-goldman-sachs>, is being paid $47m for last year. The Wall Street Journal <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/goldman-sachs-boosts-ceo-david-solomon-s-pay-21-to-47-million> notes that this is 21% more than Solomon was paid for 2024. It includes $3.4m of carried interest  </news/private-equity-carried-interest>so that he feels like he works in private equity.

What's required to earn that kind of money at Goldman Sachs? You can possibly do it as a very, very successful trader - three years ago, Goldman's commodities traders were reportedly  </news/2022/01/goldman-sachs-bonuses>anticipating $30m each. And every year, Goldman pays a mysterious group of 13 </news/goldman-sachs-pay-london> people over $9.5m in London.

In Solomon's case, though, the big payday reflects his fine job running Goldman Sachs and there is the helpful equivalent of a report card <https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/8k/2026/8k-01-23-26.pdf> explaining why Goldman felt moved to pay him so much. This says that Solomon "continued" doing many things, including creating "shareholder value", generating "strong momentum" on executing strategic priorities and emphasizing a strong risk and controls environment. Solomon's report says he also displayed a desirable, "enduring and relentless focus" on Goldman's culture and core values.  

All of this sounds relatively easy. Goldman's share price is up 32% on last year, but this is partly to do with the easing of bank capital rules <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-26/us-bank-stocks-xlf-bnks-revival-depend-on-relaxed-rules-and-deal-recovery> imposed after the financial crisis than Solomon's prowess personally. "The regulatory environment over the last five years put costs and burdens on the firm that we now won't have going forward," he said on the firm's results call this month. The FT <https://www.ft.com/content/bb658ce5-95a8-4888-a253-8f3b8ea10f36> noted last July that revisions to US stress test methodology have benefitted Goldman in particular, which saw its potential losses under the tests fall from an estimated $18bn to just $300m after private equity investments were excluded from the Fed's market shock scenario. Goldman, in particular, has a lot of these.  

While David Solomon's pay may be nice for David Solomon, his report card contains some reassurance for others at Goldman, too. Solomon has also continued with the "advancement" of Goldman's "people strategy," says the card. In doing so, he has considered, "the ongoing competitive threat to our best talent from both traditional banking peers as well as alternative asset managers and other non-bank liquidity providers."  

In simple language, this means that Solomon's pay reflects his awareness that Goldman's best people are being tempted by hedge funds </news/finance/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> and electronic trading firms.  </news/difference-between-electronic-trading-firms>He's being paid generously to reflect that. Maybe they are too? 

Separately, hedge funds might pinch more of Goldman's people this year. The Wall Street Journal < https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/hedge-funds-are-back-on-top-after-a-long-alpha-winter-f5c7cd21?mod=hp_lead_pos2> notes that a recent Goldman Sachs survey of fund managers found that a net 45% of them plan to increase their exposure to hedge fund this year. This is an all-time high for the survey, which dates back to 2017. 

Meanwhile...

Chris Hohn </news/chris-hohn> has made a lot of money, but his hedge fund TCI Fund Management doesn't look much like a hedge fund.

Davos is a highlight of the year for some of the most elite executives in finance. This year has been unforgettable for them, but not necessarily for the right reasons.

Due in no small part to the involvement of the Trump administration, this year's World Economic Forum featured plenty of drama, cheers, jeers and even a $5bn lawsuit.

            <description><![CDATA[McKinsey, Bain – and BCG, collectively known as MBB – are the gold standard of management consulting jobs. Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG </news/how-to-get-a-job-at-the-big-four> – collectively known as the Big Four </news/working-for-the-big-four-pwc-deloitte-ey-kpmg> – are the silver standard.

It’s more complicated than that. Compensation for entry-level consultants has risen in recent years, just not by very much – and generally far below the US inflation rate since 2020.

Figures in the tables below are taken from careers coaching firm Management Consulted. The final row of each table, detailing the “real decline” after adjusting for inflation, was calculated by the change in pay from 2020 to 2026 accounting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation in the USA. 

Undergraduates and masters’ degree students who went into consulting this year found themselves with a rough draw. In real terms, their compensation was overwhelmingly down on their colleagues who joined in 2020. The situation was worst at PwC, where graduate compensation had been fixed at $102k since the pandemic. The equivalent pay this year with an adjustment for inflation would be around $127k, a figure 24% higher than today’s.

Only McKinsey paid its undergraduate and masters graduate hires better than they did in 2020, adjusted for inflation – all the MBB firms were more generous than their Big Four peers, in fact.

 Unfortunately, the situation was not much better for graduates of MBA and PhD programs who went into consulting. Compensation was again lower across the board, with only EY paying a higher rate than it did in 2020 adjusted for inflation. The worst decline was at KPMG, where real pay was down by 13%.

 What’s driving the pressure on consultant pay? Among other things, Artificial Intelligence (AI). Accenture, for example <https://www.ft.com/content/a74f8564-ed5a-42e9-8fb3-d2bddb2b8675>, commenced a $865m restructuring project in September last year specifically targeting employees that could not be “retrained for the age of artificial intelligence”, in the words of the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/a74f8564-ed5a-42e9-8fb3-d2bddb2b8675>.

The biggest AI evangelists, however, are at McKinsey & Co. The firm confirmed to Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/mckinsey-workforce-ai-agents-consulting-industry-bob-sternfels-2026-1> last week that it employed around 25,000 AI agents to work alongside its 40,000 flesh-and-blood human beings. 18 months ago, it employed only a few thousand. In another 18 months from now, it planned to have one AI agent per employee. 

Additionally, the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/de7855f0-f586-4708-a8ed-f0458eb25586> noted last week that McKinsey was restructuring its recruitment tests by asking junior aspirants to use an AI assistant called Lilli in its tests for business school graduates. The use of Lilli appears to be mandatory.

There are other factors at play beyond AI. In 2025, government spending on consultants came under fire both in Canada <https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-feds-consultants> and the USA <https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/31/deloitte-is-hit-hardest-by-trumps-spending-clampdown-on-consultants/>, a market worth more than US$75bn annually.

 What’s driving the pressure on consultant pay? Among other things, Artificial Intelligence (AI). Accenture, for example <https://www.ft.com/content/a74f8564-ed5a-42e9-8fb3-d2bddb2b8675>, commenced a $865m restructuring project in September last year specifically targeting employees that could not be “retrained for the age of artificial intelligence”, in the words of the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/a74f8564-ed5a-42e9-8fb3-d2bddb2b8675>.

The biggest AI evangelists, however, are at McKinsey & Co. The firm confirmed to Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/mckinsey-workforce-ai-agents-consulting-industry-bob-sternfels-2026-1> last week that it employed around 25,000 AI agents to work alongside its 40,000 flesh-and-blood human beings. 18 months ago, it employed only a few thousand. In another 18 months from now, it planned to have one AI agent per employee. 

Additionally, the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/de7855f0-f586-4708-a8ed-f0458eb25586> noted last week that McKinsey was restructuring its recruitment tests by asking junior aspirants to use an AI assistant called Lilli in its tests for business school graduates. The use of Lilli appears to be mandatory.

There are other factors at play beyond AI. In 2025, government spending on consultants came under fire both in Canada <https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-feds-consultants> and the USA <https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/31/deloitte-is-hit-hardest-by-trumps-spending-clampdown-on-consultants/>, a market worth more than US$75bn annually.

            <description><![CDATA[As we reported last week, Citi is cutting jobs </news/citi-job-cuts-2026-bonuses> before it announces bonuses.  </news/banker-bonuses>Now, it appears to be cutting jobs after it announces bonuses, too.

Alongside the bank's 1,000 pre-bonus job cuts flagged last week, Reuters <https://www.reuters.com/world/citigroup-lay-off-more-employees-march-sources-say-2026-01-23/> reports that Citi also intends to cut an undisclosed number of employees in March, once bonuses are paid.

The cuts are causing apprehension. Insiders at Citi tell us that in both cases they are wary that the bank has paved the way for mass redundancies with an unusually strict round of performance reviews. 

Citi's staff appraisals </news/citi-promotions-investment-banking> are based on a rating system. Employees are rated between one (the highest) and four (the lowest). This year, insiders who claim they were historically always rated as a one or two, say they have suddenly been rated as three for "no reason." 

"I got dreadful ratings for the first time in 10 years at the bank," one Citi employee tells us. "The reasoning behind it was vague and other internal stakeholders were very positive. I feel very exposed!" 

Another Citi insider says long-term employees accustomed to being ranked as 1s and 2s are increasingly being ranked as 3s. "They are targeting long-term high performers by issuing a low performance grade," they allege.

The complaints, which may be unfounded, come after Citi has hired heavily into its investment bank under Vis Raghavan </news/citi-vis-raghavan>. Despite the addition of numerous banking recruits, many from JPMorgan </news/jp-morgan-s-latest-big-citi-hire-might-be-joined-by-more-after-bonuses>, Citi kept expenses in its investment bank flat last year. 

At the same time, there are early reports of "mixed" bonuses, with some in Citi's markets business allegedly zeroed. However, for 2026, Citi has relaxed its cost guidance with the bank now targeting a group-wide cost ratio of "around" 60%, instead of the below 60% number it was aiming for previously. 

A Citi spokesperson said: "Citi has always held our colleagues to high standards, and we will continue to do so as we build on the strong results we’re delivering." They added that Citi will continue cutting headcount this year and that the cuts, "reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our transformation work, which is nearing target state.

            <description><![CDATA[Bank of America excepted, US banks have announced their bonuses  </news/goldman-sachs-bonuses-are-announced-thursday-jp-morgan-people-must-wait>for 2025. If you work in M&A they seem to have been strong. But if you work in a support role, a new feebleness has appeared.

At Morgan Stanley, where Asian bankers reportedly </news/goldman-sachs-bonuses-are-announced-thursday-jp-morgan-people-must-wait> received 20% bonus increases and London bankers received uplifts of 15%, insiders say mid-ranking operations staff were greeted with less favourable news when their bonuses were announced. 

"We were told that the compensation plan architecture had changed for VPs and above and that we'd get a smaller bonus and higher base pay," says one Morgan Stanley operations insider. "It soon became clear that this wasn't the case - many of us received no base salary increase and were told we were at the upper end of the pay range."

Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

At Goldman Sachs, people say that bankers received fine bonuses but that markets professionals were less happy and that engineering and operations bonuses were "hit badly." The firm also declined to comment.

Poor bonuses can be a catalyst for quitting jobs. When staff leave voluntarily, banks don't have to pay severance. 

Roles in technology, operations and the middle office </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking> are particularly susceptible to automation. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said last week that the bank has replaced 2,000 technologists with AI, and that BofA has cut headcount in the finance team using a "series of prompts." Notably, AI does not require a salary or a bonus.

            <title>FCA staff objecting to their imminent office return say they&#39;ve been ignored</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/fca-return-to-office</link>

            <description><![CDATA[As we reported this week </news/fca-back-to-the-office>, the Financial Conduct Authority wants its people back in the office but many of them would really like to stay at home. 

Emails sent to staff by the FCA, combined with the contents of an internal chatroom, both shared with eFinancialCareers, highlight the awkward stand-off. 

On one hand, the FCA has tried to be accommodating. It's only asking for most of its people to be in the office 50% of the time (60% for executive directors and directors). It's only assessing compliance with this diktat every three months, giving staff leeway to distribute in-office days across 60-day periods. And it's delaying the imposition of the new requirements until September, so that parents can work from home during the summer holidays. It's even paying £300 to support its homeworkers, again.

As at SocGen </news/french-bank-s-gentle-job-cuts-don-t-mean-people-are-happy-there>, however, FCA people seem disinclined to feel all that grateful. Working from home is very popular. It seems that coming into the office is not.

When the change was announced this week, an FCA meeting (attended online by its homeworkers) was deluged with disparaging comments. Employees seemed particularly exercised by the fact that the regulator had asked them whether they wanted to return to the office, that they'd said "no," and yet, they were being ignored. “It seems slightly odd to have a staff survey and then ignore the majority response to the main question,” said one typical commenter.

Another claimed that staff weren't being listened to and said: “What’s best for the organisation is a happy ship. A happy ship is a productive ship." The same person observed that the summons to the office followed other unpopular changes like a higher excess on Bupa, the removal of bonuses and the introduction of "the awful bell curve" rating system.  In combination, they said these are not the best for morale. The comment received 31 likes and six 100% emojis.

Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's deputy chief executive, emailed staff on Tuesday to explain that the increased time in the office will encourage "greater collaboration and innovation" and strengthen a "shared sense of purpose" among other things. Her staff are not so sure. “Apparently we are all going to have more ad hoc conversations in the lifts and that will magically produce an improvement in organisational productivity,” wrote one.  “How does this improve f2f collaboration when there is no guarantee that those you wish to collaborate with attend the office on the same days?,” wrote another.

A spokesperson for the FCA told us: “Colleagues will inevitably have a range of views on the change, and most of the discussions we’ve had have focused on how we make it work. We believe a 50/50 split between time in the office and at home will deliver greater collaboration and innovation, support the mentoring and development of colleagues, help us to solve complex or novel problems more easily, improve communication and strengthen our shared sense of purpose – all of which enrich us an organisation.”

Many banks now expect people in the office full-time. As well as allowing people to spend 50% of the week at home, the regulator has a subsidized restaurant,a subsidized coffee bar and a subsidized fitness centre. It also offers interest free loans for season tickets (to get into the office as required).

            <description><![CDATA[SocGen is cutting some more people. The French bank doesn't report its fourth quarter results until February and won't pay its bonuses until March, but the Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/493fc3f1-50bc-4724-939f-d9ec2889459f> reported earlier this week that it intends to cut 1,800 jobs. This is seemingly supplementary to its other plan, reported by Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/socgen-s-bernstein-jv-seeks-to-cut-france-workforce-by-third>, to cut a third of the people (70 jobs) at its Paris equities joint venture with Alliance Bernstein.

The 1,800 job cuts will, at least, be gently executed. They're due to happen before the end of 2027 and will be entirely the result of natural attrition. At 4.5% of SocGen's total 40,000 person headcount, the implication is that SocGen will simply wait for people to leave of their own accords.  </news/banking-recruitment-s-sorry-story-more-candidates-fewer-jobs>

Are SocGen's French staff happy with this approach? Sadly not. More details are due imminently but for the moment, a post <https://www.cgtsocgen.fr/component/content/article/la-politique-du-fait-accompli-rencontre-avec-alexis-kohler-mercredi-21-janvier-2026?catid=210&amp;Itemid=101> by representatives of the CGT Union in relation to the plan suggests discontentment. 

The CGT claims it's been asking to meet SocGen management to discuss the reorganisation since June 2025, but has now been hit by a plan that's already conceived. The plan includes more digitalisation, the removal of layers of management, more internal mobility (including a mobility career campus) and the formation of multidisciplinary teams of combined skills across areas like data management, lending and KYC.

The cuts come after SocGen people were summoned back to the office <https://www.cgtsocgen.fr/component/content/article/la-politique-du-fait-accompli-rencontre-avec-alexis-kohler-mercredi-21-janvier-2026?catid=210&amp;Itemid=101> four days a week in June. Many are still grumbling about this. "A significant percentage of employees applied for formal flexible working," says one employee at SocGen in London. "Even people with written medical and occupational health recommendations are being rejected." 

Maybe they will leave, and add to the 1,800 cuts.

SocGen didn't respond to a request to comment.

            <title>Morning Coffee: JPMorgan&#39;s pay hierarchy shows who it likes best. The most petulant client in the world </title>

            <description><![CDATA[JPMorgan has made some regulatory filings. They are about pay. Not for the rank and file, who don't get their own regulatory filings, but for the executives who run the bank and who receive more than the rest. 

The filings, which are here <https://jpmorganchaseco.gcs-web.com/?field_nir_sec_cik_target_id=&field_nir_sec_date_filed_value=&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B471%5D=471&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B611%5D=611&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B616%5D=616&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1821%5D=1821&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1826%5D=1826&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B676%5D=676&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B681%5D=681&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1666%5D=1666&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1671%5D=1671&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1946%5D=1946&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1971%5D=1971&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B516%5D=516&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1166%5D=1166&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B1436%5D=1436&field_nir_sec_form_group_target_id_1%5B2316%5D=2316&items_per_page_toggle=0&&&page=0>, depict the hierarchy at the top of the hierarchy. CEO Jamie Dimon is predictably at the pinnacle. JPMorgan revealed yesterday  <https://jpmorganchaseco.gcs-web.com/static-files/0a08f13c-bba9-4915-abb1-18adbc8138fd>that after consideration of his "holistic performance", it will be paying Dimon a $1.5m salary and a $41m bonus, of which the FT  <https://www.ft.com/content/340ee8ce-46fe-4107-ac9b-595fbb16ca1e>notes that $5m will be in cash and $36.5m will be in stock. At today's share price, this implies that Dimon is getting over 120,000 JPMorgan shares. 

Filings for Dimon's underlings aren't as complete. They only reflect the stock bonuses awarded to the C-Suite. These bonuses have been distributed as follows:

Once again, therefore, it appears that JPMorgan's smile is falling particularly warmly on Mary Callahan Erdoes </news/mary-callahan-erdoes-jpmorgan>, the CEO of its asset and wealth management business, and a historic proselytizer for the 12-hour day six-day week.  </news/mary-callahan-erdoes-jpmorgan>Erdoes, who began working for JPMorgan in 1996, is frequently one of the bank's best rewarded people. This year, she has been awarded three times as many shares as Leopold, the head of HR.

Neither Erdoes nor Leopold can sell their stock and immediate lie on a beach with their riches. It vests in two tranches, in January 2028 and January 2029.

Separately, you probably don't want to annoy Donald Trump. Not only will you be omitted from the invitation to what the Wall Street Journal <https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/inside-trumps-private-reception-with-ceos-in-davos-543ef7d8?mod=panda_wsj_author_alert> suggests was a peculiar party at Davos with no chairs and some high tables, but you might be sued $5bn.

Jamie Dimon was invited to Donald's peculiar party, but the WSJ says he left early when Donald was 90 minutes late. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America didn't seem to be invited at all. 

It's not clear whether Dimon's disappearance was noticed by Trump, but yesterday Trump sued JPMorgan for $5bn <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/trump-sues-jpmorgan-dimon-for-5-billion-over-alleged-debanking> for "debanking" him after the US Capitol riots. The FT  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/trump-sues-jpmorgan-dimon-for-5-billion-over-alleged-debanking>suggests that Brian's absence from the table party was a possible punishment for Bank of America's similar refusal to open a bank account for Trump in 2021. 

Not attending a party is one thing. Being hit with a $5bn fine, even if it does turn out to be spurious, is another. Trump is not exactly a client, but senior bankers used to dealing with singular characters may want to treat him as such. Dimon previously  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/dimon-says-he-would-be-more-polite-in-criticizing-europe>told a Davos meeting that he “would be more polite" than Trump when referring to Europe's weaknesses. This may not have gone unnoticed. 

For the moment, JPMorgan is attempting to patch things up with gentle language intimating that the government's own money laundering legislation gave it no choice but to close Trump's accounts. 

“We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company,” a spokesman for the bank told the WSJ <https://www.wsj.com/finance/president-trump-sues-jpmorgan-for-5-billion-for-closing-his-bank-accounts-17892253?mod=hp_lead_pos1>. “We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so. We have been asking both this Administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position...”

When we last had comparable figures </news/graduate-applications-to-banking-jobs>, Morgan Stanley had the lowest acceptance rate of its peer group, with only 0.43% of intern applicants being accepted to its EMEA programs. Goldman Sachs and Citi, the only other firms for which we had EMEA figures, accepted 1% and 1.58% of applicants respectively.

Getting a job offer with more than 200 people competing per place is difficult. Very difficult, even. You’ll want to be extensively prepared – including for the critical interview process.

Luckily, if you’ve gotten this far, you’ve done the tough part. If a bank is interviewing you, that means they want you – and that means the ball is in your court. Don’t mess it up – it shouldn’t be too hard, as long as you prepare enough.

The questions below come from a variety of sources, including (but not limited to) Glassdoor, WallStreetOasis, and Reddit. They’re mostly, but not exclusively, questions asked of interns, mostly in America and the UK. And they’re all, as far as we can tell, questions that have been asked in the last six months.

            <description><![CDATA[The big appeal of working as a quant researcher </news/quant-jobs-finance> at a hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> or trading firm is the performance-based bonuses, but it's always nice to have a healthy base salary. According to data from the H1B salary database, there are plenty of firms paying a base above $200k

Click here to follow our new WhatsApp channel, and get instant news updates straight to your phone 📱 <https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VacsPmzKGGGK91C7dR39>.

Below, we've broken down average pay for quant researchers </news/what-is-a-quant-researcher-hedge-fund> at 30 hedge funds and trading firms that posted H1B salaries for multiple quant employees. Based on over 270 data points for quantitative researchers since the start of 2025, the average salary in the US is $190k, slightly lower than the New York average of $198k. 

Miami </news/citadel-miami> is the top paying city in the US, but one of the joint-top paying firm is a lesser-known prop trading firm from New York.

Since the start of 2024, Five Rings </news/2023/05/hedge-fund-prop-trading-firm-salaries> has paid eight H1B quantitative researchers a salary of exactly $300k. Each of those has been based in New York. Current job listings reflect those figures; experienced quant researcher openings and even quant internships at the firm post a flat average salary of $300k. Overall pay is likely much higher than that; Five Rings paid $1.06m per head to its London office in 2024 despite the firm making an $11m loss. Five Rings describes itself as having an "open and fun culture", <https://fiverings.com/> and is notably founded by ex-Jane Street partner (and Ferrari driver <https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corse-clienti/drivers/jason-mccarthy>) Jason McCarthy. Jane Street also pays $300k to its 'researchers' (quant is absent from their title).

The highest paying hedge fund is Point72, which hires multiple H1B quants in its IAC (internal alpha capture) team and pays almost $250k on average. At the higher end, one of these IAC researchers earned a salary of $400k. The next highest paying hedge funds are Citadel and Two Sigma, which each pay ~$230k

It's worth noting that these salaries are just a snapshot of earning potential and don't reflect the full picture for salaries. Funds are known not to play the H1B lottery </news/quants-on-h1-b-visas> when hiring quants, meaning most of these hires have been brought in from larger multinational corporations like banks or FAANG firms. The data, therefore, leaves out homegrown talent </news/hedge-funds-with-graduate-training-programmes> that funds and trading firms have been increasingly prioritizing the development of. It also doesn't include some of the most senior employees who've worked in the US long enough to obtain a green card, or workers brought in on 'exceptional talent' O1-A visas.

These days, the highest paying roles for quants aren't pure quant researchers. Instead, elite trading firms want hybrid </news/the-rise-of-the-quant-engineer-infra-hybrid> candidates who can do a little bit of everything, including quant development </news/2023/03/quant-developers-vs-quant-researchers> and infrastructure engineering.

            <title>Hedge fund Two Sigma hired a top Goldman Sachs AI technologist in London</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/two-sigma-goldman-sachs-applied-ai</link>
            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/InpSWhCzRUqP6E2qJFds" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[Goldman Sachs is one of the banks (cautiously </news/the-study-suggesting-goldman-sachs-was-right-about-ai-all-along>) leading the charge on AI, </news/how-to-get-a-banking-ai-job> so much so that it's already using the technology as a justification to cut staff. </news/goldman-sachs-job-cuts-ai> Some hedge funds </news/best-place-to-work-hedge-fund> have been on the hype train even earlier, however, and one that has been using generative AI </news/agentic-ai-generative-use-cases-finance> as early as 2019 just poached one of Goldman's top AI technologists.

Francesco Maria Delle Fave has joined Two Sigma in London as a senior vice president for AI and machine learning, working on tools that power the quant fund's research platform. He's a PhD mathematician that spent the last eight years working at Goldman across a number of roles, including EMEA head of applied AI and EMEA head of its data science and machine learning in quantitative finance (DSML QF) team. He first joined the firm as a quant strat. </news/strats-jobs-investment-banks>

Delle Fave has previously professed an interest in reinforcement learning (RL) </news/2023/10/will-ai-replace-traders-goldman-sachs>, a comparatively niche AI technique compared to machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). He's also a big fan of synthetic data. Two Sigma, too, has been working on RL since at least 2021 <https://www.twosigma.com/articles/a-24x-speedup-for-reinforcement-learning-with-rllib-ray/>. The fund is also a veteran in the natural language processing space; AI core team lead Mike Schuster said <https://www.twosigma.com/articles/how-to-get-the-most-from-llms/> at a Columbia University conference in 2024 that Two Sigma had used generative AI for at least five years and NLP for more than a decade.

Two Sigma's London office pays staff well; 'wages and salaries' in its UK entity were £377k ($507k) </news/two-sigma-pay-london> per head in its most recent annual accounts via Companies House, above the likes of Citadel and Brevan Howard. </news/best-paying-hedge-funds> In the US, Two Sigma employs AI researchers on $220k in salary alone. </news/top-paying-ai-jobs>

            <description><![CDATA[Larry Fink must have known that it was going to be a tough job when he agreed <https://www.ft.com/content/f8a5c4e8-8706-4c29-96b7-fb6cd4eb8cb4> to become interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, the organising committee of Davos.  It must have felt like the billionaire equivalent of the PTA job or carnival organising committee board that nobody wants to do, and so which ends up being done by the most public-spirited person present.  But even in his worst stress dreams about this year’s party, he can’t have foreseen himself trying to calm down a hostile crowd <https://www.ft.com/content/e2ae0417-6146-4428-96db-0484a6b024d1> at a dinner where Al Gore heckled the US Secretary of Commerce and the President of the European Central Bank walked out.

It has been that kind of a year.  Historically, the criticism of Davos has been that it’s tended to be a bit boring or vapid, with middlebrow celebrities <https://www.politico.eu/article/davos-desirables-celebrities-world-economic-forum-altman-benioff-william-yeoh-macron-amherd-dimon-reeves-dalio-maxima-philippe-mathilde-sting-coster-waldau/> trying to act like serious businesspeople and philanthropists, as CEOs sang show tunes <https://kiteinsights.com/issues-that-matter/investing-in-skills-is-the-commitment-that-counts-0> and pretended to understand algorithms.  This year, the headlines have been more about “possible imminent annexation <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cjrzjqg8dlwt> of NATO” than “whither women in biotechnology”.  Even the celebs <https://news.sky.com/story/sir-david-beckham-refuses-to-answer-sky-news-questions-in-davos-13496537> have been more newsworthy than usual.

So even if nobody else remembers their thank you letters, the news media ought to be wishing Larry a hearty “best Davos ever” as they pack up their snow boots.  But it might be the last one.

Because apparently, Fink is considering moving the WEF meetings <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/fink-ponders-moving-wef-meetings-from-davos-to-dublin-or-detroit> to “Dublin or Detroit” (these might have been picked because they begin with the same letter) or to “Jakarta and Buenos Aires”.  And that would be a totally different vibe.

It’s obviously more convenient for the attendees to hold the conference in a normal city where you aren’t booking up the entire hotel space plus a little bit more.  And the embarrassment factor of having all the private jets practically visible from the climate change panels would be reduced. But it’s not all about convenience.

If the WEF takes place in a city, the CEOs of major banks are likely to spend most of their time at their local office doing normal work, and then just hop downtown for their panels and meetings.  That reduces the opportunities for informal contact and chance meetings that take place when there’s nothing else to do and you’re suddenly in a town where half the population are CEOs.

Also, you can’t ski in Dublin or Jakarta, and if you wander round central Detroit looking for a piano bar you might have a nasty encounter.  For decades, Davos has been the ultimate banker freebie.  It’s incredibly expensive, but the company pays and you get to have fun.  If it’s just another economic forum, it’s gradually only going to attract the kind of people who actually enjoy panel sessions about opportunities in African telecoms. 

If this happens to Davos, it might as well be a Zoom call.  That would be a lot less stress for BlackRock’s CEO to organise, but a sad day for ambitious and fun-loving bankers.  At least they will have gone out with an unforgettable bang.

Elsewhere in the world, the general atmosphere of chaos that’s characterised the beginning of 2026 is fantastic news for those who profit from volatility.  And among that number are bankers in the equity-linked bond market <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-21/asia-equity-linked-deals-start-2026-strongly>.  The Hong Kong market has already done $2.5bn of convertibles deals so far this year; that’s the best start since 2021 and just about double the pace of 2025, which was itself a record year for issuance.

Convertibles are always attractive to investors and issuers when equity volatility is high, because this increases the value of the embedded option, giving the companies a lower coupon and investors more upside.  They also tend to benefit from a “success breeds success” effect – they are slightly unconventional financial instruments, so it’s good to be able to point nervous clients toward recent deals that have gone well.  And a healthy convertibles market is always good for the overall industry, because the investor base tends to include a lot of hedge funds who actively trade them.  Local specialists for global banks like Goldman Sachs’ Christian Lhert and BoA’s Sam Ng are going to be good people to know this year.

Barclays has started the formal process to begin moving its European headquarters from Dublin to Paris. While this may make it less convenient for future Davos summits, it recognises that the “financial capital of Euroland” battle has been definitively won.

More Davos kerfuffle – US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has claimed that Christian Sewing called him up to disavow George Saravelos’ research report.  Deutsche is neither confirming nor denying, saying that “We generally do not comment on potential communication between the bank and government representatives” and reminding everyone that the point of an independent research department is that it’s not telling you what the management thinks in the first place.  (Reuters <https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/bessent-says-deutsche-bank-ceo-called-distance-bank-analysts-greenland-report-2026-01-21/>)

After yesterday’s announcement of Alex Berkett, Citi have made another hire from industry.  Anand Govind was until recently the CFO of O9 Solutions, a cloud computing company.  But before that he was a tech industry banker for JPM and MS, and now he’s going to be an MD focused on AI and software company coverage.

A little bit of care is needed in reading the headline this story – Ben Frost of Goldman Sachs is a “retail banker” in the sense of being an investment banker covering the consumer and retail sector, not a “retail banker” in the sense of ever having been involved with the Marcus or credit card ventures.

“The Narrative” is a quite unusual sounding documentary, premiering at a Swiss film festival this week and featuring Kweku Adoboli, the former UBS trader who was responsible for over $2bn of undisclosed losses.  The film doesn’t give much context for what happened, but allows Adoboli to give his side of the story, and shows his new life in Ghana, after being deported from London at the end of his jail sentence.

Well, not a lot. Very little, in fact. But they do have one important thing in common: their love over the top and wildly exaggerated titles. How many secretaries did the Soviet Union need? Around a million. How many Vice Presidents does Goldman Sachs need? Around 10,000.

Of course, a Goldman Sachs Vice President does not have the ear of CEO David Solomon. And neither does his boss. Maybe his boss’ boss does – but even then, definitely not regularly.

Why so many VPs (and directors and managing directors)? It’s a long story – there are a number of reasons that are hard to pin down. For one, investment banking is a very transient industry for most individuals. People come and go quite quickly, and part of a bank’s incentivization scheme is (slightly exaggerated) seniority.

A banker who is VP-tier (this can also mean an executive director in Goldman itself) is the bottom rung of the real hierarchy at a bank. At Morgan Stanley, for example, VPs are the lowest tier of its “officer” ranks, which also include directors and managing directors.

At VP level, bankers also begin to meet clients more regularly, and their opinions slowly start to matter. And because clients prefer talking to people that have at a bare minimum the semblance of seniority and authority, banks give VPs a title worthy of some respect.

Either way, VPs are nowhere near the top of any bank’s pyramid. Below them are analysts and associates; above them are a variety of titles such as senior vice president, director, executive director, and the highest “regular” title in the banking world – the highly coveted “Managing Director” (MD) title.

Above MD, there are occasionally partners (which are functionally the same), most famously at Goldman </news/goldman-sachs-partners-list-2024>, as well as various department and regional heads with very specific functions.

What does everyone do? As ever, it’s complicated.

Analysts

What is an investment banking analyst?

Analysts are the most junior people in an investment bank. They fulfill a variety of functions depending on which department of a bank they are in.

In the investment banking division (IBD, which involves M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs> and capital markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm>), analysts have a number of responsibilities. They research companies involved in a deal and build financial models to value them. They then put together pitchbooks – PowerPoint presentations for their bosses (the MDs) to present to their clients.

"Junior bankers are experts on financial modelling," said Alexandra Michel, a former Goldman banker turned academic. They are also experts in Excel, VBA, and in PowerPoint, to build the presentations that banks use to communicate their ideas to clients. "The more junior you are in M&A, the more time you will spend working on Excel models and PowerPoint Presentations," another ex-Goldman analyst said.

A current analyst at a European bank said that analysts usually just do whatever it is they’re told to do. "The analyst is the person who does all the administration work necessary in the deal process. As the most junior person, you might work on research, you might create the materials for the pitch-book which presents banks' ideas to clients, and you might work on the financial models - but what you do will be quite basic."

Former JPMorgan associate Maninder Sachdeva said that <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHcgMgjiRb8>, when he was an analyst, in the course of a single day he worked on "maybe 10 different Excel files and maybe four or five different presentations" for clients. Analysts are notorious for getting "pls fix" (please fix) requests - after putting the presentations together, they'll often be asked to make corrections by the bankers above them in the hierarchy. These requests can come through at all hours, day or night. They are expected to answer them promptly.

Some analysts complain that their work is very boring and repetitive. “As an analyst, you spend 75% of your time on PowerPoint, making presentations,” one said.

During a dearth of deals, as occurred in 2023, analysts spend a lot of time on these 'pitches,' but not much actual time working on the process ('executing') the deals that result. Even in busy times, though, analysts are more focused on pitching than execution.

How long do you spend as an analyst?

Traditionally, three years. There’s been a recent trend towards shorter analyst stints – expect two years at most banks now.

How much do investment banking analysts earn?

Quite a lot, all things considered. In London </news/london-bank-analyst-pay>, for instance, recruitment consultancy Pretraga Partners says that analysts can earn anywhere between £55k ($74k) and £90k ($121k) in salary, with bonuses up to £60k ($81k), for a total compensation of between £90k ($121k) and £136k ($182k).

Pay in New York is pretty similar </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses>. Bands are between $110k and $135k in pure salary depending on bank and seniority, according to Litquidity. Bonuses were also more generous, up to $90k. Total compensation therefore reached around $225k at the highest end.

How many hours do you work as an investment banking analyst?

Quite a lot. Former Morgan Stanley analyst Florian Koelliker studied junior bankers for his 2021 dissertation and found that analysts typically worked between 80 and 90 hours a week. One analyst told Koelliker that leaving at 2am was "ok" and that leaving at 4am was "late."

If that seems like a lot, it is - and it even used to be worse. A scandalous presentation was leaked during the pandemic </news/2021/03/goldman-sachs-analyst-survey-working-hours> by some disgruntled Goldman Sachs juniors who complained about working 100-hour weeks. Things are better now, for what it’s worth – JPMorgan, a similarly tough task master, capped </news/jpmorgan-restrict-working-hours-banking> junior hours a few years ago to 80 a week “in most cases.”

Why so many hours? Because an analyst’s job is to fix things. A presentation or model sent to a senior banker is expected to be fixed – beginning immediately, no matter what the time of day is. That can mean in the morning at 9am, or in the morning at 3am.

"In the day it's quite hard to focus on one task at a time, because you'll have all these inbounds of random requests and tasks, so you never really get to focus on long project work," Mani said. "But in the evenings, when most of your clients and seniors are no longer at their desks, it's kind of nice to be able to work on things at your own speed and own time."

Associates

What is an investment banking associate?

An associate is a step above an analyst. Not a very big one – an associate has either just graduated from a bank’s analyst program after a few years of service or has joined the bank directly as an MBA graduate.

Associates don’t do anything that much more important than an analyst does, other than managing them. "As an associate, you're still working on the PowerPoint slides," an M&A analyst told us. "You also work more on the [financial] models."

An associate's role is partly to "guide the analyst in preparing the presentation and doing the research," the analyst said. The analyst does the work and the associate checks it." The associate is still an important part of the process. If you have a 50-page presentation, the analyst will usually do 30-40 pages, and the associate will check them and do the rest."

Associates are still expected to do analyst-type work, one former associate said, although she says that "analysts are technically the producers of all the work and the associates are the checkers of it."

How long do you spend as an associate?

Again, around three years, if you don’t quit or get culled </news/vitoria-okuyama> for poor performance – which does happen.

How much do investment banking associates earn?

More than analysts do. A survey by Litquidity last year </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses> found that salaries for associates in the USA could range anywhere from $175k to $225k and bonuses from $99k to $275k depending on seniority and employer. That puts total compensation somewhere from $274k to $500k.

London salaries are a bit lower, ranging from £100k ($134k) to £150k ($202k), and come with bonuses up to £125k ($168k). The range of compensation in London is approximately £174k ($234) to £251k ($337k).

How many hours do you work as an investment banking associate?

Associates still work a lot, although a bit less than analysts.

That perception changed significantly, however, with the death of Leo Lukenas </news/bank-of-america-says-leo-lukenas-didn-t-work-120-hour-weeks>. Lukenas was a 35-year-old MBA graduate and special forces veteran who worked at Bank of America, as part of the Financial Institutions Group (FIG).

The FIG team of an investment bank is known to work particularly long hours, and Lukenas, an associate, is alleged to have worked 120 hours a week </news/associate-at-us-bank-said-to-die-after-working-120-hour-weeks> before his death, which Bank of America denied. Lukenas was later announced to have </news/cause-of-death-banking-associate> died of natural causes by the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.

One analyst told us that “you'll often see the associates going home at 11pm instead of midnight. But that kind of depends upon the person and how good the analyst is. If you're a lazy associate with a good analyst, you can leave early. If you're an ambitious associate with a bad analyst, you'll still be working at 2am."

Vice Presidents (VPs)

What is an investment banking vice president (VP)?

Being a VP is the point at which your career in banking starts to get a bit more interesting. At this point, you’ll get to meet clients as someone more than just an overpaid briefcase transporter. Your opinion will matter.

You’ll also have more responsibility over the analysts and associates below you that are utilizing all the relevant components of the Microsoft Office suite. "Being a VP requires more ‘ownership’ in the team - and well-established client relationships," one associate at an international bank said.

"VPs lead the layout of the presentations," a Goldman banker explained to us. "They're responsible for making sure the pitch documents are put together and they will also have an active daily role in executing any deals that go ahead."

A VP’s domain is the day-to-day processes of a deal. "The VPs guide the analysts and associates," the M&A analyst said. “They're the ones saying which materials need to be created. However, they're also the ones who speak on the calls to the clients. They help keep the clients up to date with how things are progressing."

How long do you spend as a Vice President (VP)?

In theory three years, but it’s complicated.

The ranks above VP are difficult to get into. There’s competition for fewer spaces. Some people reach VP and stay there indefinitely, never quite being as good as each incoming cohort of bankers who can peg them to limited and coveted director and managing director roles.

How much do investment banking vice presidents (VPs) earn?

According to figures from Litquidity </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses>, VP salaries are tighter bound than their subordinates’ – between $250k and $275k. Bonuses, however, make the difference, with senior VPs at top boutique banks </news/boutique-investment-banks> earning an additional $500k in bonuses, compared to junior VPs at middle market </news/2023/02/middle-market-banking-jobs> banks earning just $180k on average. 

In London, total compensation ranges between £232k ($312k) and £370k ($497k), with higher weightings towards salaries rather than bonuses.

How many hours do you work as an investment banking vice president (VP)?

Koelliker’s research found that VPs work between 60 and 80 hours each week. "The associate is running the process for the VP, so the VP gets to leave earlier," the analyst said. This doesn't mean they leave early, however. "Our VP goes home around 10pm," he added.

Directors and Managing Directors (MDs)

What is an investment banking director or managing director (MD)?

Your job as a director or MD (especially as an MD) is to bring in business.

There’s a lot of travelling. It’s not as glamorous as you think, especially with perks being stripped </news/investment-banking-perks> from MDs at many banks. "As a director, you'll speak a lot with the clients," one analyst said. "Your role is to act as the interface between the client and the rest of the team."

MDs are at the top of the investment banking totem pole. "They talk to the clients, meet the clients, bring in the revenues and build the business for the bank," the analyst said. "They're the connectors, the relationship builders, they're out there, finding out what's going on with their clients in their industry."

If you do well and bring in business, you’ll be referred to as a rainmaker.

How long will I be a director/managing director (MD)?

Forever? Never? It’s complicated.

Not every bank has a director title, but if yours does, you’ll hypothetically be one for two years before you join the ranks of the MDs. In reality, for the same reasons as the VPs, you may very well never make MD. Anecdotally, being a director is also the riskiest position to have in a bank: you cost a lot of money and haven’t got a client book to balance it out. Consider it the MD waiting room.

If you’re an MD, you’ll stay there until you get kicked out or choose to retire. There’s a lot of pressure to justify your high pay package, and if you’re not performing you’ll be hard to justify for the bank’s bottom line. If you succeed – congratulations, you’re wealthier than God. If not, sorry.

How much money do investment banking directors/managing directors (MDs) make?

This number varies wildly and is much more intimately tied to the revenue you bring to the bank than in lower ranks. Recent research from us </news/2022/01/managing-director-salaries-banks> found that $400k was around the standard salary for an investment banking MD. That’s in spite of us declaring that “$500k was the new $400k” a few years ago </news/2022/01/managing-director-salaries-banks>.

The bulk of your pay as a revenue-generator will be from your bonus. This figure can easily reach millions </news/goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-morgan-stanley-citi-bank-of-america-pay-eu> of pounds/dollars/euros if you’re good at your job.

We found in our 2024/2025 compensation report </banking-compensation-guide> that investment banking directors earned average salaries of $267k and average bonuses of $280k for total compensation of $547k.

How many hours do you work as an investment banking director/managing director (MD)?

Thankfully, directors work a little less than VPs, Koelliker found. He noted that directors work between 45 and 70 hours a week and have much more control over their time.

Finally, a glimpse of work-life balance, right? Just wait until you reach MD.

MDs are both constantly – and never really – working. "Sometimes we don't see the MDs in the office much," said one analyst. "Their jobs are a bit more freestyle and flexible. They might be out of the office for a week, meeting clients. They might have lunch with a client, and then a coffee, and then a meal with another client. They might go and meet a COO who's also a personal friend."

A bank is happy to let its MDs take time to build client relationships – Goldman Sachs estimated </news/2016/11/important-job-goldman-sachs-now> a few years ago, for instance, that it takes seven years for a client relationship to generate fees for the firm.

Although banks are hierarchical, they can also be fairly egalitarian. If you perform well, you can progress through the hierarchy (at least to VP level) fairly quickly. In IBD, Michel said, most people actually do get promoted up to the next level. This makes banks less competitive places than people expect. Power differentials are minimized, and everyone (according to Michel) works for a common purpose. Unfortunately, she also concludes that this can lead to overwork and burnout.

How long do you spend as an associate?

Again, around three years, if you don’t quit or get culled </news/vitoria-okuyama> for poor performance – which does happen.

How much do investment banking associates earn?

More than analysts do. A survey by Litquidity last year </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses> found that salaries for associates in the USA could range anywhere from $175k to $225k and bonuses from $99k to $275k depending on seniority and employer. That puts total compensation somewhere from $274k to $500k.

London salaries are a bit lower, ranging from £100k ($134k) to £150k ($202k), and come with bonuses up to £125k ($168k). The range of compensation in London is approximately £174k ($234) to £251k ($337k).

How many hours do you work as an investment banking associate?

Associates still work a lot, although a bit less than analysts.

That perception changed significantly, however, with the death of Leo Lukenas </news/bank-of-america-says-leo-lukenas-didn-t-work-120-hour-weeks>. Lukenas was a 35-year-old MBA graduate and special forces veteran who worked at Bank of America, as part of the Financial Institutions Group (FIG).

The FIG team of an investment bank is known to work particularly long hours, and Lukenas, an associate, is alleged to have worked 120 hours a week </news/associate-at-us-bank-said-to-die-after-working-120-hour-weeks> before his death, which Bank of America denied. Lukenas was later announced to have </news/cause-of-death-banking-associate> died of natural causes by the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.

One analyst told us that “you'll often see the associates going home at 11pm instead of midnight. But that kind of depends upon the person and how good the analyst is. If you're a lazy associate with a good analyst, you can leave early. If you're an ambitious associate with a bad analyst, you'll still be working at 2am."

Vice Presidents (VPs)

What is an investment banking vice president (VP)?

Being a VP is the point at which your career in banking starts to get a bit more interesting. At this point, you’ll get to meet clients as someone more than just an overpaid briefcase transporter. Your opinion will matter.

You’ll also have more responsibility over the analysts and associates below you that are utilizing all the relevant components of the Microsoft Office suite. "Being a VP requires more ‘ownership’ in the team - and well-established client relationships," one associate at an international bank said.

"VPs lead the layout of the presentations," a Goldman banker explained to us. "They're responsible for making sure the pitch documents are put together and they will also have an active daily role in executing any deals that go ahead."

A VP’s domain is the day-to-day processes of a deal. "The VPs guide the analysts and associates," the M&A analyst said. “They're the ones saying which materials need to be created. However, they're also the ones who speak on the calls to the clients. They help keep the clients up to date with how things are progressing."

How long do you spend as a Vice President (VP)?

In theory three years, but it’s complicated.

The ranks above VP are difficult to get into. There’s competition for fewer spaces. Some people reach VP and stay there indefinitely, never quite being as good as each incoming cohort of bankers who can peg them to limited and coveted director and managing director roles.

How much do investment banking vice presidents (VPs) earn?

According to figures from Litquidity </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses>, VP salaries are tighter bound than their subordinates’ – between $250k and $275k. Bonuses, however, make the difference, with senior VPs at top boutique banks </news/boutique-investment-banks> earning an additional $500k in bonuses, compared to junior VPs at middle market </news/2023/02/middle-market-banking-jobs> banks earning just $180k on average. 

In London, total compensation ranges between £232k ($312k) and £370k ($497k), with higher weightings towards salaries rather than bonuses.

How many hours do you work as an investment banking vice president (VP)?

Koelliker’s research found that VPs work between 60 and 80 hours each week. "The associate is running the process for the VP, so the VP gets to leave earlier," the analyst said. This doesn't mean they leave early, however. "Our VP goes home around 10pm," he added.

Directors and Managing Directors (MDs)

What is an investment banking director or managing director (MD)?

Your job as a director or MD (especially as an MD) is to bring in business.

There’s a lot of travelling. It’s not as glamorous as you think, especially with perks being stripped </news/investment-banking-perks> from MDs at many banks. "As a director, you'll speak a lot with the clients," one analyst said. "Your role is to act as the interface between the client and the rest of the team."

MDs are at the top of the investment banking totem pole. "They talk to the clients, meet the clients, bring in the revenues and build the business for the bank," the analyst said. "They're the connectors, the relationship builders, they're out there, finding out what's going on with their clients in their industry."

If you do well and bring in business, you’ll be referred to as a rainmaker.

How long will I be a director/managing director (MD)?

Forever? Never? It’s complicated.

Not every bank has a director title, but if yours does, you’ll hypothetically be one for two years before you join the ranks of the MDs. In reality, for the same reasons as the VPs, you may very well never make MD. Anecdotally, being a director is also the riskiest position to have in a bank: you cost a lot of money and haven’t got a client book to balance it out. Consider it the MD waiting room.

If you’re an MD, you’ll stay there until you get kicked out or choose to retire. There’s a lot of pressure to justify your high pay package, and if you’re not performing you’ll be hard to justify for the bank’s bottom line. If you succeed – congratulations, you’re wealthier than God. If not, sorry.

How much money do investment banking directors/managing directors (MDs) make?

This number varies wildly and is much more intimately tied to the revenue you bring to the bank than in lower ranks. Recent research from us </news/2022/01/managing-director-salaries-banks> found that $400k was around the standard salary for an investment banking MD. That’s in spite of us declaring that “$500k was the new $400k” a few years ago </news/2022/01/managing-director-salaries-banks>.

The bulk of your pay as a revenue-generator will be from your bonus. This figure can easily reach millions </news/goldman-sachs-jpmorgan-morgan-stanley-citi-bank-of-america-pay-eu> of pounds/dollars/euros if you’re good at your job.

We found in our 2024/2025 compensation report </banking-compensation-guide> that investment banking directors earned average salaries of $267k and average bonuses of $280k for total compensation of $547k.

How many hours do you work as an investment banking director/managing director (MD)?

Thankfully, directors work a little less than VPs, Koelliker found. He noted that directors work between 45 and 70 hours a week and have much more control over their time.

Finally, a glimpse of work-life balance, right? Just wait until you reach MD.

MDs are both constantly – and never really – working. "Sometimes we don't see the MDs in the office much," said one analyst. "Their jobs are a bit more freestyle and flexible. They might be out of the office for a week, meeting clients. They might have lunch with a client, and then a coffee, and then a meal with another client. They might go and meet a COO who's also a personal friend."

A bank is happy to let its MDs take time to build client relationships – Goldman Sachs estimated </news/2016/11/important-job-goldman-sachs-now> a few years ago, for instance, that it takes seven years for a client relationship to generate fees for the firm.

Although banks are hierarchical, they can also be fairly egalitarian. If you perform well, you can progress through the hierarchy (at least to VP level) fairly quickly. In IBD, Michel said, most people actually do get promoted up to the next level. This makes banks less competitive places than people expect. Power differentials are minimized, and everyone (according to Michel) works for a common purpose. Unfortunately, she also concludes that this can lead to overwork and burnout.

Well, not a lot. Very little, in fact. But they do have one important thing in common: their love over the top and wildly exaggerated titles. How many secretaries did the Soviet Union need? Around a million. How many Vice Presidents does Goldman Sachs need? Around 10,000.

Of course, a Goldman Sachs Vice President does not have the ear of CEO David Solomon. And neither does his boss. Maybe his boss’ boss does – but even then, definitely not regularly.

Why so many VPs (and directors and managing directors)? It’s a long story – there are a number of reasons that are hard to pin down. For one, investment banking is a very transient industry for most individuals. People come and go quite quickly, and part of a bank’s incentivization scheme is (slightly exaggerated) seniority.

A banker who is VP-tier (this can also mean an executive director in Goldman itself) is the bottom rung of the real hierarchy at a bank. At Morgan Stanley, for example, VPs are the lowest tier of its “officer” ranks, which also include directors and managing directors.

At VP level, bankers also begin to meet clients more regularly, and their opinions slowly start to matter. And because clients prefer talking to people that have at a bare minimum the semblance of seniority and authority, banks give VPs a title worthy of some respect.

Either way, VPs are nowhere near the top of any bank’s pyramid. Below them are analysts and associates; above them are a variety of titles such as senior vice president, director, executive director, and the highest “regular” title in the banking world – the highly coveted “Managing Director” (MD) title.

Above MD, there are occasionally partners (which are functionally the same), most famously at Goldman </news/goldman-sachs-partners-list-2024>, as well as various department and regional heads with very specific functions.

What does everyone do? As ever, it’s complicated.

Analysts

What is an investment banking analyst?

Analysts are the most junior people in an investment bank. They fulfill a variety of functions depending on which department of a bank they are in.

In the investment banking division (IBD, which involves M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs> and capital markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm>), analysts have a number of responsibilities. They research companies involved in a deal and build financial models to value them. They then put together pitchbooks – PowerPoint presentations for their bosses (the MDs) to present to their clients.

"Junior bankers are experts on financial modelling," said Alexandra Michel, a former Goldman banker turned academic. They are also experts in Excel, VBA, and in PowerPoint, to build the presentations that banks use to communicate their ideas to clients. "The more junior you are in M&A, the more time you will spend working on Excel models and PowerPoint Presentations," another ex-Goldman analyst said.

A current analyst at a European bank said that analysts usually just do whatever it is they’re told to do. "The analyst is the person who does all the administration work necessary in the deal process. As the most junior person, you might work on research, you might create the materials for the pitch-book which presents banks' ideas to clients, and you might work on the financial models - but what you do will be quite basic."

Former JPMorgan associate Maninder Sachdeva said that <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHcgMgjiRb8>, when he was an analyst, in the course of a single day he worked on "maybe 10 different Excel files and maybe four or five different presentations" for clients. Analysts are notorious for getting "pls fix" (please fix) requests - after putting the presentations together, they'll often be asked to make corrections by the bankers above them in the hierarchy. These requests can come through at all hours, day or night. They are expected to answer them promptly.

Some analysts complain that their work is very boring and repetitive. “As an analyst, you spend 75% of your time on PowerPoint, making presentations,” one said.

During a dearth of deals, as occurred in 2023, analysts spend a lot of time on these 'pitches,' but not much actual time working on the process ('executing') the deals that result. Even in busy times, though, analysts are more focused on pitching than execution.

How long do you spend as an analyst?

Traditionally, three years. There’s been a recent trend towards shorter analyst stints – expect two years at most banks now.

How much do investment banking analysts earn?

Quite a lot, all things considered. In London </news/london-bank-analyst-pay>, for instance, recruitment consultancy Pretraga Partners says that analysts can earn anywhere between £55k ($74k) and £90k ($121k) in salary, with bonuses up to £60k ($81k), for a total compensation of between £90k ($121k) and £136k ($182k).

Pay in New York is pretty similar </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses>. Bands are between $110k and $135k in pure salary depending on bank and seniority, according to Litquidity. Bonuses were also more generous, up to $90k. Total compensation therefore reached around $225k at the highest end.

How many hours do you work as an investment banking analyst?

Quite a lot. Former Morgan Stanley analyst Florian Koelliker studied junior bankers for his 2021 dissertation and found that analysts typically worked between 80 and 90 hours a week. One analyst told Koelliker that leaving at 2am was "ok" and that leaving at 4am was "late."

If that seems like a lot, it is - and it even used to be worse. A scandalous presentation was leaked during the pandemic </news/2021/03/goldman-sachs-analyst-survey-working-hours> by some disgruntled Goldman Sachs juniors who complained about working 100-hour weeks. Things are better now, for what it’s worth – JPMorgan, a similarly tough task master, capped </news/jpmorgan-restrict-working-hours-banking> junior hours a few years ago to 80 a week “in most cases.”

Why so many hours? Because an analyst’s job is to fix things. A presentation or model sent to a senior banker is expected to be fixed – beginning immediately, no matter what the time of day is. That can mean in the morning at 9am, or in the morning at 3am.

"In the day it's quite hard to focus on one task at a time, because you'll have all these inbounds of random requests and tasks, so you never really get to focus on long project work," Mani said. "But in the evenings, when most of your clients and seniors are no longer at their desks, it's kind of nice to be able to work on things at your own speed and own time."

Associates

What is an investment banking associate?

An associate is a step above an analyst. Not a very big one – an associate has either just graduated from a bank’s analyst program after a few years of service or has joined the bank directly as an MBA graduate.

Associates don’t do anything that much more important than an analyst does, other than managing them. "As an associate, you're still working on the PowerPoint slides," an M&A analyst told us. "You also work more on the [financial] models."

An associate's role is partly to "guide the analyst in preparing the presentation and doing the research," the analyst said. The analyst does the work and the associate checks it." The associate is still an important part of the process. If you have a 50-page presentation, the analyst will usually do 30-40 pages, and the associate will check them and do the rest."

Associates are still expected to do analyst-type work, one former associate said, although she says that "analysts are technically the producers of all the work and the associates are the checkers of it."

How long do you spend as an associate?

Again, around three years, if you don’t quit or get culled </news/vitoria-okuyama> for poor performance – which does happen.

How much do investment banking associates earn?

More than analysts do. A survey by Litquidity last year </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses> found that salaries for associates in the USA could range anywhere from $175k to $225k and bonuses from $99k to $275k depending on seniority and employer. That puts total compensation somewhere from $274k to $500k.

London salaries are a bit lower, ranging from £100k ($134k) to £150k ($202k), and come with bonuses up to £125k ($168k). The range of compensation in London is approximately £174k ($234) to £251k ($337k).

How many hours do you work as an investment banking associate?

Associates still work a lot, although a bit less than analysts.

That perception changed significantly, however, with the death of Leo Lukenas </news/bank-of-america-says-leo-lukenas-didn-t-work-120-hour-weeks>. Lukenas was a 35-year-old MBA graduate and special forces veteran who worked at Bank of America, as part of the Financial Institutions Group (FIG).

The FIG team of an investment bank is known to work particularly long hours, and Lukenas, an associate, is alleged to have worked 120 hours a week </news/associate-at-us-bank-said-to-die-after-working-120-hour-weeks> before his death, which Bank of America denied.

If you're a lazy associate with a good analyst, you can leave early. If you're an ambitious associate with a bad analyst, you'll still be working at 2am."

In London, total compensation ranges between £232k ($312k) and £370k ($497k), with higher weightings towards salaries rather than bonuses.

How many hours do you work as an investment banking vice president (VP)?

Koelliker’s research found that VPs work between 60 and 80 hours each week. "The associate is running the process for the VP, so the VP gets to leave earlier," the analyst said. This doesn't mean they leave early, however. "Our VP goes home around 10pm," he added.

Although banks are hierarchical, they can also be fairly egalitarian. If you perform well, you can progress through the hierarchy (at least to VP level) fairly quickly.

Adam Swiecicki, former CFO of banking fintech Brex </news/the-fintech-decacorn-cutting-hedge-fund-hires-gave-staff-one-hour-to-leave> and current CFO of workforce/payroll management fintech Rippling, recently appeared on a podcast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn422o_Wx4s&t=1794s> from VC firm </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-venture-capital> Kleiner Perkins. He said that someone with a strategic finance background should be "the first hire that you want to make." Specifically, he said you should be looking for a "generalist Swiss army knife" with a background in banking or private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity>; Swiecicki previously worked in M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs> for Morgan Stanley and had stints in both PE and hedge funds. </news/best-place-to-work-hedge-fund> Swiecicki says this role is particularly important for early stage firms as they can become "the thought partner to the CEO" and identify the best areas for growth. 

Michael Miao, an ex-Deutsche Bank investment banker and current VP of finance for automation startup Glean, agreed. He said that finance roles in startups are much more than an accounting function, which he said "you can and should outsource" early on. Instead, CFO roles are about critical thinking and being "a general purpose finance athlete" capable of interpreting the very messy data that's part and parcel with startups. This means being very good at Excel (or rather Google Sheets, which Miao said he controversially loves despite being a former "excel enthusiast").

Swiecicki advised against hiring directly from banks or PE firms for early-stage CFOs, instead preferring alumni who already had experience at a startup. "There's just too high of a probability they don't like working at an early stage company," he said. 

It's becoming increasingly popular for startups to hire 'fractional CFOs', part-time workers who may be acting as CFO for multiple other startups at once. It's a controversial move; Kirsty MacDonald, a principal at VC firm JamJar Investments, said at last year's Sifted Summit that she "[has] not seen that work yet." Instead, she prefers hiring finance executives full time by providing "something that is way more exciting and interesting than their current career path."

The excitement for bankers joining fintech is often about having 'skin in the game' in the form of early stage equity. The later you join an early stage firm, though, the less you earn; Peter Walker, head of insights at Carta said late last year </news/fintech-startup-jobs-equity-pay#:~:text=You%20might%20think,normal%20doesn%27t%20last.> that the first hire by a startup averages 1.5% equity in their company, but that falls to just 0.3% by the sixth hire. If fintechs want the most elite ex-bankers leading their finance function, they'll need to heed Swiecicki's advice of hiring them first.

            <description><![CDATA[Citi is an outlier among major US banks in its commitment to hybrid working, so much so that even executives spend a couple of days at home per week </news/citi-hybrid-working-cio>. As other firms in the industry make their staff spend additional time in the office, it gives the bank opportunities to capitalize on talent.

The bank has just hired Andrea Bowe in London; she announced on LinkedIn yesterday that she's joining Citi as a managing director (MD) of regulatory strategy and policy for the UK, Europe and MEA. She joins from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which she first joined two decades ago. She held various roles at the regulator, including chief of staff and joint director of transformation. 

We reported yesterday </news/fca-back-to-the-office> that the FCA sent a memo to staff mandating that executive directors spend at least 60% of their time in the office, up from a previous policy of 40%. This change means that staff are now in the office the same amount as Citi employees, who also have to spend three days in the office per week, but Citi is seen as a much more appealing career option, given that insiders told us the FCA pays no bonuses and offers lower salaries. It's highly unlikely that the move materialized in the past 24 hours, but Bowe may have seen the policy change coming.

Citi's hybrid offering isn't just generous compared to other US banks. Our bonus expectations report </news/bank-bonus-expectation> found that Citi staff spend the least time in the office </news/days-in-the-office-by-bank> of all banks surveyed, including European players like Deutsche Bank and HSBC. However, in tough market conditions, staff have reported a marginal 1.2% increase in time spent in the office.

            <title>Morning Coffee: Vis Raghavan&#39;s latest ex-JPMorgan hire isn&#39;t like the others. Davos is making CEOs nervous about saying the wrong thing</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/alex-berkett-citi</link>

            <description><![CDATA[It’s pretty uncommon, if by no means unknown, for people to have careers that go back and forth between advisory work at an investment bank, and management roles in the industries being advised.  Most commonly, you’ll see ambitious young executives shift from investor relations and corporate strategy jobs on the buy-side to middle-ranking positions in M&A or coverage teams, or senior bankers at MD level deciding that they want to take a chance building a company of their own rather than spending their time working on other folks’ deals.

What’s quite a lot more unusual is something like Alex Berkett’s <https://www.wsj.com/business/media/citi-hires-former-paramount-executive-to-head-media-banking-5b25f99e?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcm4hsKViBfeI3UREfvRqwBYJNjmCL4d566rTkumFr_7L4Twd8pRlxtMIeIkEY%3D&gaa_ts=696fed9a&gaa_sig=CAiSZH7kmYqNAoV8WdvjRtbs2d1elFQSP4twi_RfihnlEKVxJp7wLL4DGarW4kEkwZwJaEKGU3nmP9QYSQ4BrA%3D%3D> career trajectory, which is now taking him to lead Citi’s media team reporting to Vis Raghavan via Dan Richards, the global head of media and communications.  Like many of Raghavan's recent hires, he's previously worked at JPMorgan; unlike many, he’s gone from banking, to industry and then back again.

If it hadn’t have been for the global financial crisis, Berkett might have had a more conventional career; he was at Bear Stearns for 11 years.  By the time that Bear got taken over by JP Morgan he had risen to the position of Managing Director; his social media <https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-berkett-5488899/details/experience/> suggests that he was given the title of “Executive Director” after the takeover, so it’s perhaps not surprising that less than a year later he went to FiveWire Media <https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/new-private-equity-firm-to-focus-on-media/>, an investment company (it would probably have been called a SPAC if it was launched ten years later) which had been launched by two private equity investors to make acquisitions of media businesses.

After that company made its deals and IPOed, in 2014 he went to a corporate strategy job at Viacom. After quite a lot of mergers and name changes, that company ended up being called Paramount Global, and after helping arrange its takeover by David Ellison’s investment company Skydance, Berkett left at the end of last year.  Now he’s back in banking.

This sort of career trajectory is often quite well respected by clients.  Although Berkett will have considerably fewer lucite tombstones in his office than someone who had been working in investment banking consistently for the last sixteen years, he has been on every side of the table you can think of – banker, client, investor and corporate executive.  Unlike people who have never worked outside banking, he can empathise with the people who will still have to live with the consequences of an M&A transaction long after the fees are banked and the celebration dinner digested.

Elsewhere, bankers are treading very carefully in Davos.  Not because it’s particularly icy underfoot – the pictures available <https://www.businessinsider.com/davos-wef-live-updates-jan-20-2026-1#trumps-setting-the-greenland-agenda-at-davos> suggest that you’d be fine in sensible footwear – but because the political climate seems to be more risky than usual.  Former Goldman Sachs banker and current Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney <https://bbc.com/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o> has announced a new “new world order”, UBS’s Sergio Ermotti has warned that selling off US assets would be a “risky bet <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/exiting-us-assets-is-a-dangerous-bet-ubs-ceo-ermotti-says>” and in anticipation of President Trump’s imminent arrival, everyone is wondering what might happen next <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-20/a-dash-of-deja-vu-for-dealmakers-at-davos?taid=696f8db27707d0000111eb50&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_content=business&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter>.

The representatives of global finance might be forgiven, therefore, for trying to keep a low profile, restricting their public statements to wondering about the future of AI or saying that Indonesia is at a crossroads <https://www.cracked.com/article_44614_the-economist-turned-this-off-hand-simpsons-joke-into-a-twenty-year-long-running-gag.html>.  But Larry Fink of BlackRock, at least, is flying the flag for globalism and the Davos Consensus. 

He’s delivered a classic <https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-fink-blackrock-ceo-davos-critiques-capitalism-ai-wealth-inequality-2026-1> of the “billionaires talk to millionaires about the working class” genre, telling the audience that capitalism isn’t working and that “wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain”. 

As the interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum (after the retirement of Klaus Schwab), Fink might feel obliged to continue the message of inclusive capitalism, but some might think that it all sounds unfashionably ESG-adjacent.

Meanwhile…

The anticipated gold rush in 2026 means that this is a good time to persuade bankers that they might gain from a rebalancing of their compensation between fixed and variable. The London offices of JP Morgan and Citi are having another look at “role based allowances”, which used to be used as balancing items to reconcile the global pay norms with the European bonus caps.  Sweetening the pill somewhat, a number of banks will also be rebalancing the overall compensation packages between long term equity-related units and immediately accessible cash. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/jpmorgan-citi-weigh-ending-fixed-pay-allowance-for-key-uk-staff?utm_medium=email&utm_source=author_alert&utm_term=260120&utm_campaign=author_21061455>)

Citi now has 4000 employees enrolled in its “Ai Champions and Accelerators” program, each devoting three to five hours a week to trying to persuade their colleagues to make more use of chatbots and similar tools. (Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-bank-ai-accelerators-volunteers-2025-12>)

HSBC, on the other hand, is teaming up with a legal AI startup called Harvey, to help its in-house legal function do document reviews, contract analyses and compliance tasks a bit faster. (Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/hsbc-rolls-out-legal-ai-platform-with-harvey-7d2d6dca?mod=topic_news>)

ABSA is building up its African investment banking business at the expense of local competitor Standard Bank. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/top-african-lender-standard-bank-loses-more-dealmakers-to-absa>)

While Houlihan Lokey is on the acqui-hire trail, buying Audere Partners in Paris, and the real estate capital advisory business of Melium Capital. (Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/houlihan-lokey-strikes-two-more-deals-in-european-expansion-aea968da?mod=topic_news>)

The Herbert Affordability Formula is a piece of real estate maths that’s meant to ensure that some of the space in your new urban development will be available for artists, giving the place an attractive and desirable bohemian vibe that will attract the bankers who make the overall project viable. (FT <https://www.ft.com/content/fd311a07-d7ba-4b0f-960b-114c2bf3d5bb>)

If the most reliable indicator of a bubble is “nearly all the Harvard MBA graduating class go into finance”, then we’re nowhere near one.  In fact, lots of newly minted graduates of elite business schools are finding it hard to get a job at all.  On would-be banker is now “considering luxury retail after spending some time in Paris”, the hardship is real. (WSJ <https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/even-mbas-from-top-business-schools-are-struggling-to-get-hired-11f4a167?mod=hp_lead_pos11>)

Another former banker gives a view on the TV series “Industry”, adding to the consensus that it’s broadly realistic (enough to trigger some unpleasant memories), but that it’s more common to experience three or four of that kind of incident over the course of a whole career than half a dozen every week. (I News <https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/working-in-banking-industry-tv-show-real-life-4175425>)

In memos sent to staff today, the FCA said it wants executive directors to be in the office 60% of the time each month. Other staff will need to be in the office 50% of the time. The changes will take effect from September 2026. 

Sources at the FCA informed us yesterday that the changes were coming. The FCA initially intended to inform staff of the changes on January 28th but was compelled to announce the changes internally today.

FCA staff currently spend 40% of their time in the office and 60% at home. Sources at the regulator say that working from home is a major attraction of working there. 

The FCA says that spending more time in the office will, "deliver greater collaboration and innovation, support the mentoring and development of colleagues, help us to solve complex or novel problems more easily, improve communication and strengthen our shared sense of purpose – all of which enrich us an organisation."

One FCA insider told us: "The FCA offers no bonus and pays less than the private sector. The two day a week or 40% office policy was one of the very few benefits working there."

            <description><![CDATA[Nearly one year has passed since a bomb went off in the blessed existences of HSBC's investment bankers, who were allegedly being paid seven figures to do not much at all.  </news/hsbc-bankers-pay>On January 28th 2025, the bank disclosed its intention of closing its M&A and ECM businesses </news/hscb-closure-europe-us-job-cuts> outside of Asia and the Middle East.

12 months later, HSBC remaining bankers are looking forward to this year's bonuses with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. Before bonuses are paid, though, some are leaving.

HSBC isn't commenting, but the exits are understood to include people at the highest and the lowest levels. 

At the highest level, we understand - for example - that Hugo Moore, an HSBC veteran and an MD in the financial institutions group's debt capital markets (DCM) origination team at the bank in London, has quietly exited. Moore didn't respond to a request to comment, but the FCA Register shows him leaving on January 2nd after an HSBC career that lasted over two decades.

At a more junior level, we understand that a female junior on the HSBC syndicate desk is also leaving, despite joining relatively recently and relocating for the role. She didn't respond to a request to comment on this article. 

HSBC announces its bonuses in February. Last year, it fired hundreds of people in the investment bank and let many of them go on bonus day itself, without annual payments. 

This year, HSBC insiders say the approach of bonus day is causing angst. "There's a lot of anxiety about compensation and the bonus pool," says one insider. "When you make people redundant close to compensation day it sends a bad signal," he adds. 

Last year, HSBC let go of many people without pay, while retaining others to work on projects. Insiders say there were complaints about "inconsistency" as a result. "Some people were let go without bonuses. Others were paid project completion fees and it didn't seem very fair."

            <description><![CDATA[You may earn a lot of money running the family office </news/family-office-jobs> for a high net worth individual. In the US, family office roles can pay a combined salary and bonus </news/investment-banking-salaries-bonuses> of up to $1.8m.

Staff in family offices invest money on behalf of wealthy families in a number of assets including real estate, fixed income, and stakes in hedge funds and private equity firms. Family offices have very few clients, often just a singular 'principal' representing a family. They don't employ many people and their roles can be very lucrative.

Executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles has released a compensation survey for family office </news/2013/12/family-office-ill-tell-you-what-its-really-like-to-work-in-a-family-office> employees. Heidrick mostly surveyed family office CEOs, CIOs and managing directors.

The survey found that family office staff in the northeast US (including cities like New York and Philadelphia) expected to earn an impressive $1.8m last year. Respondents in Switzerland had the highest salaries and bonuses in Europe, earning $648k in salaries and $230k in bonuses

That's not the whole story, though. Family office employees can also earn carried interest  </news/2023/02/what-is-carried-interest>in the style of private equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> professionals [add link] if investments are exited at a profit. They can also be permitted to co-invest alongside the family office.

Carried interest, co-investments and other 'additional incentives' were only on offer to ~35% of the survey respondents, but they can be very valuable. In Switzerland, where these incentives are most common, pay for family office staff was $7.2m on average, making it the highest paying region for family office pay overall.

            <description><![CDATA[Kash Rangan spent 30 years covering software stocks as an equity research analyst </news/research-job-investment-bank>. Now AI is here, doing better than ever, and Rangan is retiring.

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community.  <https://bubble.efinancialcareers.com/login?_gl=1*ut8n6u*_gcl_au*MTg4MDY2NTExNi4xNzYxNTU3NDIz*_ga*ODczNzI2NTA0LjE3NTM2OTk2ODI.*_ga_NZFQV4MXPM*czE3NjM2NDM0MDYkbzI1NiRnMSR0MTc2MzY0MzQzOSRqMjckbDAkaDMyMjc4OTUzMw..>✍️

In a social media post, Rangan thanked a multitude of people for his time at GS, with the first being his wife Yamini, who serves as CEO of San Francisco-based software firm HubSpot.

(Kash) Rangan has covered the firm in the past, when he was at BofA in 2020 – he even named it one of his top stocks to watch, according to Pulse 2.0 <https://pulse2.com/10-software-stocks-to-watch-in-2020/#:~:text=HubSpot%20Inc.,stock%20jump%20134%25%20in%202019.>. That recommendation was published before (Yamini) Rangan joined the firm, and it does not appear he has covered HubSpot since.

Since joining Goldman, most of Rangan’s attention in the last few years, much like his colleagues, and much like ours, was spent on the potential of AI, despite his usual coverage being on more traditional software companies.

Rangan has always been an AI optimist. Comparing its moment in the news and markets today to the emergence of the web browser in the 1990s, which many expected to kill existing software, Rangan explained AI as a “force multiplier” instead, leading to a rebirth of software companies <https://www.aol.com/finance/goldman-sachs-analyst-bets-ai-230214574.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jaGF0Z3B0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHHjlyU8U4zT9IY25J4MLIIAHe4-RjN2ANDY0HozAE2v_YYhULTek-KAKUhZyY01dHh_uSbCuesUi_2fh7iaANWWxld1JFF6mjIS_uMEiuBmXpMhri5Kn8ZNURAkvSH5FON_sSd0KCQ779mm4azPV6u79lwKUoTq4UtzKLM7Qg_z>.

Despite his general bullishness, a lot of Rangan’s recent optimism was related to the companies he was covering as an analyst, which were software companies. “A lot of software stocks are trading at depressed valuations,” Rangan said on a Goldman-hosted podcast <https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/are-ai-bubble-concerns-warranted-or-overblown> back in November, and pointed to the intense amount of money pouring into AI from deep-pocketed “hyper scale” giants, rather than the venture capital and private equity giants that funded the dot com boom. Rangan thought the fear that AI would eat those software companies’ lunches was unfounded.

Why quit now? Good question. If AI is a bubble, it’s one that hasn’t popped yet – and it is, by all accounts, still inflating. Perhaps a clue comes from Rangan’s retirement post. Thinking back on his time at GS, he said that he “matured in ways I had not expected,” which included “putting the client, the team and the firm before yourself.”

            <description><![CDATA[Last year was a big year for US banks in Asia </news/asia-s-bankers-and-traders-could-get-this-year-s-biggest-bonus-increases>, and 2026 is shaping up to be even bigger. Many of the top firms credited Asian businesses for an increase in last year's performance during Q4 earnings calls, and some are looking to grow their presence on the continent.

Bank of America, </news/bank-of-america-s-credit-trading-turnaround-slow-to-start-after-leadership-changes> for example, beat analyst predictions with a 23% increase in equities trading; executives said in the call that the growth was "supported by increased activity in Asia." 

At Morgan Stanley </news/morgan-stanley-equities-traders>, overall revenues in Asia grew by 50% over the last two years, as non-US revenues grew to 25% of the bank's total income. Bonuses at Morgan Stanley in Asia were thought to be good this year, up 20% year-on-year, according to Bloomberg. <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/morgan-stanley-lifts-asia-bonuses-20-after-record-revenue-haul> In 2025, Asia generated more revenues than Europe  </news/morgan-stanley-equities-traders#:~:text=in%20the%20bank%27s%20institutional%20securities%20group%2C%2026%25%20of%202025%20revenues%20came%20from%20Asia.%20Europe%20encompassed%20just%2022%25%20of%20global%20revenues%20while%2052%25%20of%20revenues%20came%20from%20the%20Americas.%20%C2%A0>within Morgan Stanley's institutional securities group, home to its investment banking and trading teams. 

Goldman Sachs  </news/goldman-sachs-q4-2025>seems to see room for improvement in its Asia franchise. Speaking during last week's investor call to discuss fourth quarter results, Goldman Sachs executives said the firm is "looking to close the share gap in Asia" with a focus on key client segments "including insurers, wealth managers and RIAs [registered investment advisors] as well as in certain product areas like corporate derivatives. "

There's a common favourite location for these banks to hire in 2026: India. Their GCCs (global capacity centres) </news/h1b-visa-outsourcing-banking-jobs-india> have hundreds of openings, while other major Asian offices like Hong Kong and Singapore are more likely to have tens. The biggest hirers in India and Asia alike are the banks that didn't have as much to say about their Asian franchises, Citi and JPMorgan.

There haven't been many senior arrivals in recent months from these banks, though. The exception is Citi's FX trading desk, which Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-26/citi-hires-nomura-wells-traders-in-fx-business-push-across-asia> reported made a number of senior hires across India, Hong Kong and Singapore.

            <description><![CDATA[Famously, the Royal Navy used to drink a toast every week to “a bloody war and a quicky promotion <https://wartime.blog/2017/12/14/customs-traditions-1-naval-toasts/>”. That’s a level of cynicism which even investment bankers might find a little excessive, but it remains true to say that in the right circumstances, geopolitical unrest can be very profitable for traders with quick wits and strong nerves.

And one of those rare periods might be about to begin. All the chat at Davos at the start of the week seems to be about the growing tensions in Greenland, and the possibility (raised, although not necessarily predicted, by Deutsche Bank’s George Saravelos) that Europeans might start to weaponise <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-18/euro-pain-from-trump-limited-by-us-asset-exposure-deutsche-says> their large holdings of US dollar denominated assets.

That is, it’s fair to say <https://www.ft.com/content/beeaf869-ca12-4178-95a1-bfb69ee27ae4>, significantly easier said than done. The United States of America is a country, not a company, so activist investment doesn’t work in quite the same way. And there are two sides to every trade; Europe can’t actually sell its dollars and Treasury bonds unless it can find someone to buy them. So in terms of the actual global situation, this probably isn’t a thing.

But nevertheless, macro traders will be hoping that some combination of geopolitics and risk aversion starts to drive investment decisions in Europe in 2026. Because even a small rebalancing of EU portfolios would be a very large trade indeed.  And the first thing you learn as a trading intern is that whenever there is a large, consistent and potentially relatively price-insensitive “wall of money” on either the bid or the offer, that’s when the sell side makes money. It’s the equivalent of a surfer seeing a smooth, regular left-to-right breaking wave.

The trouble is, of course, that to ride that wave, you have to pitch for the orders, which might involve writing research notes publicly recommending that clients sell the USA.  And that, in turn, might be a bit risky for some banks’ taste.

In particular, in a world in which the globalised and cosmopolitan financial services industry <https://www.ft.com/content/dcff161c-6fbd-45d8-899d-9ace43df3cdd> is increasingly coming into contact with a much more nationalistic political reality, the CEOs of the US bulge bracket banks might consider the whole thing to be more trouble than it’s worth. It’s probably no coincidence that it was Deutsche, rather than any of the big domestic players <https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/are-megabanks-next-in-trumps-crackdown-on-stock-buybacks-e696b466?mod=hp_lista_pos3>, that first came out with this piece of research.

Which then raises the question of who bears that political risk. If European banks start to get heavily involved in a politicised short-dollar trade, it’s not completely impossible that they might start seeing some sort of retaliation against their personnel, particularly from the immigration authorities.

The US Border Patrol has always regarded it as something of a gray area whether it’s OK for bankers to enter the country under the ESTA scheme for client meetings, and their willingness might be tested if foreign bankers start getting the blame for any slide in the markets. If you’re a London-based trader or analyst for a European bank, you might want to get your North American marketing trips finished earlier in the year rather than later.

Elsewhere, although 2025 was quite a bit better than 2024 <https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/research-commentary/2025/london-has-strongest-year-for-ipos-since-2021-with-a-strong-q4-f.html#:~:text=Global%20IPO%20market&text=The%20largest%20IPO%20globally%20in,US%20and%20one%20from%20Europe.> for the London IPO market, it’s still hard to see how the size of the domestic equity capital markets industry could be supported if the new normal is only £2.1bn of money raised (less than Spain or Turkey, placed globally immediately between Oman and Greece <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/london-drops-out-of-top-20-ipo-markets-after-69-plunge-in-fundraising>). But never fear, help is on the way.

According to the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves <https://www.ft.com/content/e3c9ac38-58c1-4762-91e2-3396946dc0e0>, who will be appearing at Davos this week, we’re about to go into a “golden age <https://www.ft.com/content/e3c9ac38-58c1-4762-91e2-3396946dc0e0>” of deals in the London market, with changes to the tax and prospectus regulations ready to bring back the days when it accounted for more than 50% of the EMEA region ECM revenue pool.

UK bankers themselves seem to be more “cautiously optimistic”, and are saying that although the changes are “welcome”, there are “many other challenges to overcome”. But investment banking is, famously, a game of second derivatives, and given the many years of lead and ashes in the recent past, even a bronze or silver age would be highly welcome.

Meanwhile…

It seems that either the Goldman Sachs, Lazard, UBS and Deutsche bankers working on Zurich’s bid for Beazley are uncommonly good at keeping their mouths shut, or the London market is so dead that nobody’s around to listen to gossip. (FT Alphaville <https://www.ft.com/content/8e714c91-feab-4516-9191-8fdcfa5a8c1d?accessToken=zwAAAZvXvJ4mkdOOcUyR_qtFFtORkY_c-lqMHQ.MEYCIQDA4nRfbvYH7XYhtLJbAz2SkR98DLwiVLAJz8SbTahxJgIhANbFMXgFh6MRCIM6IwqSXZ7s1rpKuvNFpdtg0VFzIFaT&segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&shareType=enterprise&shareId=73bf920e-f5a7-4350-b3f6-784552e74616>)

Keith Magliana and the former European credit team of Taconic Capital Advisors have now spun off into their own hedge fund, called “Dolomite”. It seems like a friendly spin off, as they are bringing across $1.1bn of assets from Taconic along with another $200m of startup capital. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-19/former-taconic-european-credit-team-spins-out-with-1-3-billion>)

“FOMO Sapiens”, and the great mental health hazard of banking – the temptation to think about what you might have been earning, the deals you might have won and the career you might have had, rather than paying attention to what’s actually happening.

If you’re leaving New York, to escape a possible “millionaire tax”, or just to go and work in Florida, you had better be careful to move all your paperwork, cancel your country club membership and not spend more than six months in the state. The auditors are apparently “very aggressive” on unpaid state taxes. (NY Post <https://nypost.com/2026/01/19/business/how-new-yorks-extremely-aggressive-tax-collectors-chase-down-people-who-leave-they-will-do-whatever-they-can/>)

“I start so early every morning that if I'm out to parties till 11 or 12 or 1, I'm just not as valuable for things that are really important, which is the chance to talk to clients”. Rich Lesser of BCG doesn’t seem to really be getting into the spirit of things at Davos.

Architects of modern office buildings are keen to use the top floors and sunlit aspects for client spaces and shared amenities to make the building more attractive to hybrid working staff. But that apparently means some awkward conversations with senior executives who have worked all their lives to get a corner office.

            <description><![CDATA[On some measures, this should be a fine time to find a job in an investment bank.  </news/what-is-an-investment-bank>2025 was an exceptional year for markets businesses: records were broken at the likes of Citi, Goldman Sachs </news/how-to-get-a-job-goldman-sachs> and Bank of America. M&A </news/get-a-job-in-ma> revenues soared in the fourth quarter of 2026 and are expected to keep on growing. As Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick observed last week, the "setup is ideal" for banks.

The setup is not, however, ideal for anyone looking for a job in a bank. When US banks reported their fourth quarter results last week, they declared a near-universal intention to keep a tight grip on headcount.  

JPMorgan, for example, will be spending an additional $9bn </news/jpmorgan-hiring-2026> this year, of which $3bn is allocated to its corporate and investment bank, and yet JPM also has a stated bias against new hiring people unless strictly necessary. Similarly, Bank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick described last week how, "every time someone leaves, we take the opportunity to evaluate whether the role needs to be replaced." And Citi said it plans to end 2026 with lower headcount, again.

Squeezing headcount means squeezing hiring. It means being efficient and doing more with artificial intelligence. At Goldman Sachs, AI is being tested on six mysterious workstreams, which the bank is keeping under wraps. At Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan said "several hundreds of millions" of dollars are being spent on AI, and that "30% of the coding technique" has been taken over by large language models (LLMs), saving 2,000 people. Last year, Moynihan also said the bank added 2,000 graduate-level hires and yet held overall headcount flat, implying a continued push for juniorisation.   </news/2017/01/juniorization-banking>

At the same time, the baseline for replacement hiring remains lower than it was in the good old days of 2016. Ten years ago, Bank of America's staff churn rate  </news/the-bank-of-america-charts-explaining-why-it-s-resorted-to-job-cuts>was 16% a year. Last year, Moynihan said churn was closer to 7.5%. Fewer people are leaving; fewer people are needed to replace them.

Within this mix, humans still need jobs. Goldman Sachs said <https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/current/pdfs/2025-q4-earnings-results-presentation.pdf> 1.1m "experienced hires" applied for jobs at the firm last year, and that it accepted fewer than 1% of them. Experienced applicants to the firm were up 10% </news/2023/10/goldman-sachs-applications> year-on-year. Similarly, applications for Goldman Sachs internships  </news/internship-investment-bank>reached 365,000 last year, up from 315,000 in 2024.   </news/goldman-sachs-acceptance-rate-interns>At Bank of America, 200,000 people applied for student jobs <https://fortune.com/2026/01/03/bank-of-america-ceo-gen-z-hiring-advice-ai/>, up from 120,000 in 2023.  </news/graduate-applications-to-banking-jobs>

As hiring is squeezed, non-front office jobs are suffering the most. Moynihan, for example, described how BofA's audit team, " has built a capability" involving a "series of prompts" that has enabled them "to shape the headcount back down."

For the moment, though, jobs in areas like sales appear relatively safe. If you want to be assured of banking employment in 2026, focus on relationships. And cling to the role you already have.

            <description><![CDATA[Unexpectedly, the top performing hedge fund </news/best-paying-hedge-funds> in 2025 wasn't Citadel, </news/pay-at-hedge-fund-citadel-in-london-500k-to-21mm> Balyasny  </news/london-pay-balyasny>or even Bridgewater </news/2023/06/citadel-interview>. Instead, it was London hedge fund TCI Capital, once home to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak </news/2022/10/rishi-sunak-goldman-sachs>, which made $18.9bn <https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/chris-hohns-tci-made-18-9-billion-last-year-shattering-hedge-fund-records-e155153b?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcZoUbbaseuj4myTEeoJvNMywQTI3wnYQ8x_jdeVG-Om8eCl1KEEyJ5FC2e5AQ%3D&gaa_ts=696e4838&gaa_sig=CUOIG1MIQwaxWPUu1qGqTl2sFjujdKha7qQ8keB_rF-6qE-13bIfPiUXOrWHqae8OpmF6xgtQYOKL3FpXD6GvA%3D%3D> last year. The Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/c670fa3a-05d8-41e5-9701-8239a9c7206f> points out that this was the largest yearly gain ever for a hedge fund. The individuals behind the success seem to have received commensurate gains themselves.

According to Companies House accounts for 'TCI Holdings Limited' for the year ending March 2025, the fund paid 16 key management personnel an average of $10.17m (£7.6m). Those 16 are defined as 'equity partners of the limited liability partnership subsidiaries of the group.' The accounts only factor in three months of last year, which means that TCI's partners may well have earned even more than that on average for 2025 as a whole.

Only around half of TCI's partner are actual portfolio managers, though. Chris Hohn, </news/chris-hohn> who runs TCI, said on a podcast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPNs8DZ0FvE> late last year that he only has 7-8 portfolio managers alongside a larger back office </news/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking>. TCI Holdings' accounts suggest the fund has a headcount of 50, but TCI has many different entities that obfuscate exact headcount figures. 

TCI trades equities, but doesn't need an army of PMs because it is interested in a very specific type of company. Hohn said he invests in "hard assets and infrastructure", with a particular affinity for aircraft engine manufacturers. The FT reported that Hohn likes to invest in companies that operate natural monopolies, 

Who are some of TCI's partners? At 'TCI Advisory Services LLP', there are five partners, including Alex Baring, who joined the fund from JPMorgan Cazenove in 2006. Max Schroeder, another partner in that entity, joined the fund in 2017 after two years as a graduate at private equity  </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity>firm Blackstone. </news/blackstone-pay-london> Jon Amouyal, a partner who joined the fund in 2012, was previously an executive director at Goldman Sachs Investment Partners in London.

'TCI Fund Services LLP', meanwhile, has eight partners, most of whom have been there for almost 20 years. The most recently appointed partners were Hal Livingstone, the firm's legal counsel, and CTO Bradd Bentley, who joined in 2014 and 2016, respectively. 

A common thread among partners is that they joined TCI earlier in their careers, often coming in as partners. Baring, for example, was hired as a partner aged just 27. Rishi Sunak joined as a partner aged 26. Tobias Brickel, the most recently appointed partner, joined the fund in 2019 just three years after graduating a masters, and was made partner the following year. 

Hohn, presumably one of TCI's key management members, doesn't spend his money lavishly. He said in the podcast that he "[doesn't] actually own anything" and gives his money away "in service of humanity."

            <description><![CDATA[Hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> Eisler Capital may have failed, but this does not mean its people are failures. Balyasny Asset Management  </news/another-eisler-pm-has-left-for-hedge-fund-balyasny>is a fan of its portfolio managers </news/2023/09/portfolio-manager-job-hedge-fund> (PMs). So too is Brevan Howard.  </news/eisler-brevan-howard>And now, Brevan has hired Eisler's second most desirable quant to accompany the former Eisler PMs it hired already.

Valdo Durrleman, who was a managing director and the head of desk strats at Eisler, has reappeared at Brevan Howard, where he is the new head of quantitative analytics. 

Brevan Howard did not respond to a request to comment on Durrleman's arrival. It's not clear whether he has shunted someone aside at Brevan or whether his is an entirely new role there. 

Durrleman spent seven and a half years at Eisler and has been a dedicated acolyte of Sam Wisnia </news/sam-wisnia-eisler>, Eisler's sometimes eccentric deputy chief investment officer. Wisnia himself joined Eisler from Deutsche Bank in 2018; so did Durrelman. Wisnia joined Deutsche Bank from Goldman Sachs  </news/2016/05/deutsche-bank-sam-wisnia-goldman-sachs>in 2015; so did Durrleman. The two are chums.

It's understood that Durrleman was instrumental in building Kannon </news/hedge-fund-eisler-capital-rumoured-to-be-selling-some-wares>, the risk and analytics system that Wisnia pioneered at Deutsche Bank. Then he was instrumental in building Photon, the similar risk and analytics system that Wisnia pioneered at Eisler. 

Writing in late December, Business Insider  <https://www.businessinsider.com/eisler-capital-shutdown-photon-sale-talent-exits-2025-12>said Eisler was considering selling Photon as a standalone product and suggested that it had spoken to rival funds Verition </news/four-people-left-hedge-fund-verition-as-teams-were-trimmed> and Taula  </news/taula-capital-hedge-fund>about buying it. Verition and Taula did not confirm this. Durrleman's disappearance may not augur well for that plan.

Brevan Howard's technology team has been through a few changes  </news/hedge-fund-brevan-howard-parted-with-company-with-7-senior-technologists>over the past year, with multiple senior people leaving. However, multiple alternative senior people have arrived, including Mike Sanders, Brevan's shiny newish CTO from JPMorgan and Tim Mace, who joined as the head of AI from Man Group. Durrleman will possibly join this cluster with a mandate to create something akin to Kannon and Photon at Brevan. Good luck!

            <description><![CDATA[Private Equity </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-private-equity> is in a peculiar place right now. Exits have fallen massively from a few years ago but, thanks to the contentious secondaries market, some people have high hopes. One bank with high aspirations for the sector, and private markets at large, is JPMorgan. </news/jpmorgan-q4-2025>

The Wall Street Journal  <https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/jpmorgan-forms-new-team-to-get-in-on-the-boom-in-private-markets-f1f2f67c?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcsI2DcpdVhmhckfN0TwMhegEBA--El1nvNmMhDTZJQS7u9_gapDhg3EI3Me94%3D&gaa_ts=696dfe98&gaa_sig=kGncCkOsWNSDUiKF0oTquf8-kjSdJgrOjVKVJsP9VIIo5h7tnIEz7fDdIB2Qy-xBKnO7EneDm8grpiKpz90Kig%3D%3D>reported on Friday that the bank will be building out a 'Private Capital Advisory and Solutions' team, known in some banks as PCA units. </news/private-capital-advisory-jobs-investment-banking> It's a relative niche in investment banks, with a few boutiques and Jefferies currently market leaders in the space. These teams focus on raising capital for private companies, many of which are PE-owned companies on the secondaries market.

The most interesting transactions in the space, 'GP-led' secondaries transactions, are controversial because they'e essentially repackaging a company the PE firm already owns and selling it to itself by cashing out existing investors (usually at a loss), moving the company into a new portfolio, and raising money from new investors. The controversy around this is, when the company is eventually sold, a PE firm can earn carried interest relative to the valuation of the portfolio company when the stake was sold on the secondaries market, rather than the price it was initially bought for. 

A report from Evercore said that the volume of the secondaries market in 2025 was $226bn and it could become even larger this year. Bankers working in PCA are getting a lot of attention, particularly from students <https://youtu.be/Rndvdqw4tRY?si=19Q0Fk1NFD8yhIm-&t=2187> looking for a graduate job in the space. Alongside it being such a new field relative to other banking units, getting to work with PE firms (and their secondaries teams in particular) makes you an attractive choice should you decide to take an exit opportunity.

Separately, while electronic trading firms </news/high-frequency-trading-hiring-and-pay> are usually known for how fiercely they protect their own secrets, they also don't want to be on the other side of a rival firm claiming their strategy has been plundered.

Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/quants-lawsuits-and-politics-inside-londons-super-secretive-trading-firms-faf16585> wrote on Friday about the many top electronic trading firms based in London. It said that following a lawsuit from Citadel Securities, GSA went "whiter than white" and stopped its staff from asking traders about their strategies in interviews. What exactly they're allowed to talk about isn't clear, but presumably there's a lot of inference going on. 

Walking on eggshells seems to have worked in the firm's favour. Companies house accounts for its LLP in 2025 show that yearly turnover has almost doubled compared to 2022, the year after it settled its lawsuit.  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-11/citadel-securities-settles-with-hedge-fund-over-secret-algorithm>

            <description><![CDATA[The finance profession is undergoing one of the fastest, most complex shifts. Markets modernise; business models flip, and technology pushes finance leaders to think faster and act smarter. 

For organisations across the Middle East and beyond, the demand for strategic, ethical and tech-literate finance leadership has never been stronger. The Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation is recognised as the global benchmark for future-ready finance professionals.

Built for the C-suite

For senior leaders like Mehdi Naoum, achieving the CGMA designation has been a defining factor in his progression to the C-suite. 

With over two decades of experience across telecoms and technology, Naoum brings a blended finance and tech mindset to his leadership.

“I always defined myself as a finance business partner, a decision helper, but I always wanted to be the decision maker,” says Naoum. 

For Naoum, the CGMA designation was not simply the next credential. It became the missing link between financial experience, strategic influence and modern leadership. That decision was also shaped by the realities of building a senior finance career in the Middle East, where professional designation still carries significant weight. 

“When selecting what to study, I asked myself what was on the CVs of the most successful CFOs, and what skills I still lacked,” he adds. 

Ethics as the core of leadership

Beyond credibility and progression, the CGMA designation also reinforced the leadership principles that matter most to Naoum.

The ethical backbone of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the CGMA framework aligned with his leadership values. It has helped him instil a culture of trust, curiosity and continuous growth across his teams. “Ethics is the background to the entire CGMA qualification. I’m an ethical person, but the CGMA professional qualification helps me structure ethics in every business thought,” Naoum states. 

What does ‘future-ready’ finance leadership mean?

For Naoum, being future-ready means developing teams that are agile, curious and prepared to continuously learn and unlearn. “Agility is critical. You need to be prepared for continuous learning and unlearning. Not all learning is good for you forever; sometimes you need to make space to unlearn.” 

He cultivates this mindset by encouraging experimentation, reflection and adaptability within his teams. This commitment to continuous learning is also why Naoum recently completed an AI masterclass, ensuring he and his teams stay ahead of emerging technologies. Naoum says; “Unless you are curious, you will not be on top of the game.”

Strengthening credibility and influence

Despite holding two master’s degrees, including an executive MBA from a top-ranked global school, Naoum saw CGMA qualification as the step that would strengthen his credibility and widen his strategic lens. He explains, “Being a CGMA qualified professional is stepping up to the decision-making stage and being very active in contributing to the main decisions in the business.”

His career in telecoms and technology shaped a leadership style built on curiosity and agility, which CGMA qualification reinforced.

Curiosity is not a personal trait; it is an expectation Naoum sets for his team. “I like the ‘why’ and the ‘how’. I want my team to be curious about why we are doing this, not be compliant blindly.” 

Three ways the CGMA designation supports C-suite leadership

Working alongside global peers exposed Naoum to new thinking, approaches and frameworks. It also helps him cut through operational noise and stay focused on what matters most.

He sees three clear areas where the CGMA professional qualification supports his day-to-day leadership:


Refreshing core concepts: grounding strategic decisions in robust fundamentals.
Sharpening day-to-day decisions: enabling faster, more confident judgement.
Ethics as a backbone: embedding integrity into every business decision.


As Naoum explains, “Ethics is the universal language that connects teams across the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.”

Navigating the hybrid finance world

Naoum highlights how the CGMA professional qualification equips him to lead in hybrid finance and tech environments, balancing innovation, risk and reward.

He explains that his company’s transformation from traditional telecoms to FinTech, Cloud, and Internet of Things (IoT) required dual-speed strategic thinking and agility.

How does the CGMA qualification help in those aspects? “Basically, it’s your toolkit. Everything comes without even thinking.” For him, the CGMA qualification is not just knowledge; it shapes decision-making, risk assessment, and strategic value creation.

Where CGMA professionals will create the most value?

Looking ahead, Naoum sees AI, data, and sustainability reporting as areas where CGMA professionals will create the most value. While AI and data can generate insight at speed, Naoum stresses that human judgement remains critical, especially in Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A).

“You still need to interpret it. You still need to angle it differently. You still need to align it to your strategy.”

Sustainability is another major focus. “Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is also a means to create value. Business today is not all about money, but value. A CGMA professional is already tackling those aspects of ESG reporting,” he says.

In the Middle East, net zero commitments and sustainability reporting are rising, increasing demand for finance leaders who can bridge strategy, ethics and execution.

Advice for aspiring CGMA professionals

Naoum encourages mid-career finance professionals to pause and assess their ambitions honestly. He says, “You want to equip yourself to get there, to the C-suite, or be comfortable saying where you are? This question is vital and more important right now.”

He reflects that while there is no perfect time to embark on further study, the designation’s intangible benefits, strategic mindset, ethical framework and credibility are invaluable.

“I should have done it five years ago. There is no perfect time, but I’m still happy I’ve done it in 2024. The value for me was always more about the intangibles.” 

The CGMA professional qualification is more than a designation. For leaders like Mehdi Naoum, it is a toolkit for navigating complexity, making ethical choices and building future-ready finance teams.

            <description><![CDATA[Nowadays, everyone wants to learn how to code in Python </news/2021/08/python-for-banking-jobs> and, thanks to vibe coding, pretty much anyone can do it. For an investment banking technology job </news/how-to-get-a-technology-job-bank>, however, you'll also need to have strong foundational knowledge </news/financial-services-technology-jobs-no-degree> in the language </news/programming-languages-for-a-career-in-finance> itself.

If you list Python on your CV </news/2023/01/best-banking-cv-engineering> and apply to a role involving Python, there are various questions banks will ask to test your knowledge. One investment bank technologist, speaking anonymously, told us the main things to know are "the major syntactic elements of Python (lambda expressions, filtering iterables, etc.), as well as the core data structures and how they work." You should also have "opinions on the type system and interpreted nature of the language."

Below are a list of 23 questions Python developers have been asked in job interviews at major banks based on Glassdoor submissions:


What is a singleton class and how do you implement it in Python?


When should you use multithreading in Python code instead of multiprocessing?


Do multithreaded programs in Python run parallel to each other?


What is object-oriented programming?


Why is Python called a dynamically typed programming language?


What is Python inheritance and its advantages


What is the difference between tuples and lists?


What are decorators in Python?


What are lambda functions in Python


Take us through a project in which you used Python


What kinds of models do you know how to run in Python?


What Python packages do you use most frequently?


How do you code a binary search in Python?


What is the difference between a dictionary and a list in Python


How do you implement a string method in Python?


How do you look at open files while running a Python script?


What are the properties of Python’s classes.


What is the global interpreter lock (GPL) in Python.


What is the main difference between a language like Python and a language like C?


What is the difference between mutable and immutable types in Python


Do you know why NumPy is so much faster than regular Python?


What is the difference between an array and a linked list?


What is PEP8?


How do you build a Monte Carlo simulation in Python?


Perhaps the most important question is 'Why is Python called a dynamically typed programming language?' The technologist said it's his favourite question to ask in interviews because "if you can really code in Python, you'll know the answer." When answering, you should note that the data types are checked at run-time, whereas statically typed languages require you to declare the data type of a variable before you can use it.

Interviewers will also make wild generalisations in the hope that you'll correct them. The technologist said that you may be asked, 'What's a list comprehension?' If you answer correctly, they may follow up with, 'So it’s the equivalent of a for-loop appending to list?' It's important that you can describe the differences; "In the list comprehension, we know what the size of the result is going to be," the technologist said. "Therefore, Python can allocate the memory upfront, which is much more efficient than dynamically adding to a list."

When speaking about Python libraries </news/python-libraries-for-finance>, interviewers "like to know that you're at least aware of things like NumPy and Pandas." In the age of AI, demonstrating knowledge of TensorFlow, PyTorch, and the differences between them </news/programming-languages-machine-learning-ai-quant#:~:text=Python/PyTorch,than%20in%20PyTorch.> is also a bonus.

You may not recognise everything in the list above, but that's okay. "It’s natural for interviewers to see how deep a candidate’s knowledge goes," the technologist said. "My advice is to be upfront and not get flustered when you don’t know something so the interview can quickly move on to something you might know."

As you should already know, you'll likely need to complete some live coding challenges in your interview.

            <description><![CDATA[One of the great things about banking is that it’s such a people business.  If you like making friends, you will have a much better time in finance than if you don’t, and if people like being friends with you then there’s no industry in which you’ll have a better career.  At the very top levels of the industry, the distinction between business and social life seems to disappear entirely; at the end of their careers, top bankers tend to give interviews in which they say things like “It’s nothing to do with skill, I’ve just been very lucky to have so many great friends who have given me jobs and deals”.  When of course, at the Managing Director level, that’s pretty much the definition of what it means to be good at your job.

Some people, however, manage to take it further, and to directly monetise their gregariousness and wide circle of acquaintances.  For example, when hedge funds are trying to expand in a new territory, they often employ BDEs or 'business development executives <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/hedge-funds-hire-talent-scouts-in-japan-to-tap-market-comeback?embedded-checkout=true>' (as opposed to the other take <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dick_energy> on this acronym).

This is a comparatively new twist to the traditional headhunter job; like a headhunter, a BDE is expected to know the market and to be able to get people to take their calls, but they are also meant to be able to identify new talent, potentially from outside the existing sector.  It’s often a role that’s occupied by sell-siders – because of the nature of their job, prime brokerage executives are often very familiar with the local hedge fund community.

Right now, business development is one of the hottest roles in the Japanese market, where interest has spiked from multistrategy firms, who are looking particularly for macro and equities traders, in a market that has suddenly become active and profitable after years of stagnation.  Although firms like Dymon Capital and Point72 want to get into the action, they know that it’s easy to make costly mistakes, and so their first moves into a new market often involve hiring a BDE with local knowledge to start talking to recruiters and acting as a kind of “talent scout”.

For people who are able to do it, this job has a lot of favourable characteristics.  As with all the best banking roles, you’re in a situation where your salary looks pretty tiny compared to the overall investment. You tend to be operating in an environment which is familiar to you but not to your boss.  And best of all, if you screw up, then your mistakes will have the two best properties possible for a banker – they will not be obvious for a few years, and there’s a high chance that they’ll be blamed on someone else. It might be that you can make more money out of your address book than your trading book.

Elsewhere, Jamie Dimon’s ability to handle difficult individuals is one of his many legendary qualities.  It seems like there might have only been two people in his life who he wasn’t able to charm. First, Sandy Weill <https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/jamie-dimon-turned-down-jeff-bezos-job-offer-amazon-bank-one/>, the early career mentor with whom he had a famous and painful falling-out.  And now, Donald Trump <https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/jamie-dimon-trump-jpmorgan-3d63a020?mod=hp_lead_pos1>.

It’s certainly not for want of trying, and he may yet manage it.  After all, up until recently, Dimon seemed to be the best Trump-whisperer on Wall Street.  Despite having closed some Trump accounts in 2021, been called “highly overrated globalist” in 2023 and the widely spread (though never confirmed) rumours of his support for Kamala Harris <https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/business/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-harris-trump.html>, Dimon managed to talk Donald round. He was even offered the job of Chairman of the Federal Reserve <https://nypost.com/2026/01/15/business/trump-says-he-has-no-plans-to-fire-powell-after-offering-job-to-jpmorgans-dimon-report/> at a meeting few months ago, although he (perhaps tactfully) treated this as a joke.

And that is the source of the current problem; probably against his will, Dimon has been drawn into the fight between Jerome Powell and the President, on the side of “don’t mess around with the money”.  Like any bank CEO, when it comes to a choice between soothing the feelings of a powerful person, and taking a risk with earnings or capital, there is only one side he was ever going to take. 

So the “frenemies” relationship has once more become a bit less “fr”.  Can Jamie repair it?  One thing is certain; if Dimon can’t, nobody can.

Meanwhile …

Mainland Chinese securities firms have been a pretty miserable place to work for the last few years. But with the return of deal flow, they are back to recruiting.  They are also beginning to lose staff as global banks try to get back into the market, and raising bonuses to close the gap versus international employers. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/china-brokers-rebuild-ranks-raise-pay-on-dealmaking-return?srnd=homepage-americas&embedded-checkout=true>)

Alantra, the mid-market advisory firm, put its staff through something of an emotional rollercoaster with its rapid expansion followed by a complete overhaul in 2024.  But it looks like they formed some bonds along the way – several of its former technology team have now formed their own boutique, called Avero. (Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/ex-alantra-dealmakers-launch-tech-focused-m-a-boutique-ce61f8dd>)

One of the big star names of British fund management, Nick Train has not had a great few years.  But he’s still in the game, having beaten a shareholder vote for the board of his investment trust to consider their strategic options. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/uk-star-manager-train-survives-investor-vote-over-trust-s-future?srnd=homepage-americas>)

Despite beating analyst forecasts for the 2025 results, Ted Pick is not tempted to raise the bar in terms of guidance.  He pointed out that “We are going to not push on robust objectives, when in fact 20% returns are pretty darn good”. (American Banker <https://www.americanbanker.com/news/morgan-stanley-beats-consensus-defends-keeping-older-goals>)

Elon Musk says that retirement savings don’t matter, because in twenty years’ time we will all be living in a post-scarcity utopia.  Most financial advisors seem to think that you should probably also plan for a less optimistic scenario. (Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-retirement-savings-wealth-ai-abundance-personal-finance-experts-2026-1>)

If you’ve lost your job at a private equity fund, why not consider working for one of its portfolio companies?  Lots of them have programs for rapid promotion from blue-collar occupations to roles where you can once more earn a six (although probably not seven) figure salary, if you are prepared to “get over yourself”. (WSJ <https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/white-collar-workers-shouldnt-dismiss-a-blue-collar-career-change-32dfa69e?mod=hp_listb_pos2>)

Of course, investment banking standards are very high. The last year we had consistent figures </news/graduate-applications-to-banking-jobs> available (2023), we found that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs accepted around 0.9% of applicants to their internships, while Bank of America accepted a rather lax 2.1% of them.

2.1%, of course, is still very competitive – it means that just one in 50 student applicants to the firm are accepted. And, in our experience, applications to non-internship roles are even more competitive </news/2023/02/goldman-sachs-acceptance-rate>. Goldman, for example, had an intern acceptance rate of 1.27% back in 2022, and a firm-wide acceptance rate of 0.33%.

As such, if you’re applying for a job there, you’ll want to be prepared. And a big part of preparation is for your interview – if you’ve gotten so far as that, the odds are in your favour, but you don’t want to fall at the very last hurdle. And the only way to really prepare for an interview is by preparing for the questions that might come your way.

The questions below come from a variety of sources, including (but not limited to) Glassdoor, WallStreetOasis, and Reddit. They’re mostly, but not exclusively, questions asked of interns, mostly in America and the UK. And they’re all, as far as we can tell, questions that have been asked in the last six months.

            <title>Goldman Sachs’ Europeans can expect big bonuses for a record end to 2025</title>

            <description><![CDATA[The Q4 reporting season for America’s big banks has concluded. Each bank had a standout performance – at JPMorgan </news/jpmorgan-q4-2025>, it was equities traders </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank>, at Citi </news/citi-q4-2025> it was M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs> bankers, and at Morgan Stanley it was capital markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> bankers. At Goldman Sachs, however, it was Europeans.

The bank breaks out revenue by geography. Across the entire year, things were pretty stable – the Americas produced around 63% of revenue in 2025, EMEA around 24%, and Asia around 13%, more or less the same as last year. Beneath the hood, however, there was some chaos.

In the final quarter of the year, Americas revenue declined by 15%, from $9.1bn to $7.7bn. At the same time, EMEA revenue increased by 33%, from $2.8bn to $3.7bn. Their respective market shares went from 66 and 20% to 57 and 27%. Asia also went up, less dramatically, from 14% to 16%.

In terms of segments, Goldman’s investment bankers </news/the-investment-banking-recruitment-process> did decently, with M&A revenue increasing by 34% on 2024, equity capital markets (ECM) revenue increasing by 6%, and debt capital markets (DCM) revenue increasing by 12%. All performance were good, but none really remarkable – Citi saw a larger M&A revenue increase, and Morgan Stanley saw a larger ECM and DCM revenue increase.

It’s Goldman’s equities traders, however, who are the firm’s darlings right now. The bank noted the highest quarter for equities revenue in Wall Street history according to Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/goldman-equity-traders-smash-through-wall-street-revenue-record>, beating its own record from Q2 of 2025, with growth of 25% in Q4 of 2025 on the same period in 2024.

Fixed income, currencies, and commodities were less of a positive note. Revenue was up only 8.9% across 2025, behind rivals. Goldman blamed the performance on its credit team, which has bled people across the entire year </news/goldman-sachs-london-credit-business>.

Still, it was a good year for the bank. Headcount reached 47,400 people, up 900 from the end of 2024. And it paid those people more - $399k on average, up from the $359k. The implication is that some very big bonuses are on their way later today </news/goldman-sachs-bonuses-are-announced-thursday-jp-morgan-people-must-wait>.

Quarterly accounts released by the bank show that Q4 equities revenues for the bank rose just 10.26% while JPMorgan's skyrocketed by 39.94%. This meant JPMorgan had the largest increase in equities revenues year-on-year, despite Morgan Stanley leading them at the nine-month mark </news/best-performing-investment-bank-2025>. It was still a great year for the bank, of course; yearly revenues rose 27.8%, more than the likes of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, which also had great years. 

Equities being the star of the Morgan Stanley show is unsurprising. Ted Pick </news/morgan-stanley-equities-trading>, now in his third year as Morgan Stanley CEO, made his name in equities. 

It's not just equities that did well; Morgan Stanley was consistently exceptional in almost every other division in banking and markets over the year. It was up 21% for the year in M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs>, up 23% and 26% in ECM and DCM </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> respectively. The exception, however, is its fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading team.

Revenues in FICC fell by 8.7% year-on-year in Q4. Citi is the only other major US bank to falter in equities in the last quarter, but fell by a much more modest 0.58%. Citi's FICC revenues were up 10% overall for the full year, while Morgan Stanley's rose a paltry 3.54%.

While US bankers and traders did a lot of the heavy lifting, it also appeared to be a particularly good year for Morgan Stanley staff in Asia. The bank's presentation to investors included a breakdown of revenues by region which showed that, in the bank's institutional securities group, 26% of 2025 revenues came from Asia. Europe encompassed just 22% of global revenues while 52% of revenues came from the Americas.

Robin Weisberg has left JPMorgan to join Jefferies as its global head of equities technology, based in New York. His last day at JPMorgan was yesterday, according to FINRA's BrokerCheck tool. He seemingly leaves the bank on a high note: JPMorgan's equities trading division  </news/jpmorgan-q4-2025>had the highest year-on-year increase in revenues for 2025 of all its teams in banking and markets.

Weisberg spent the last fifteen years at JPMorgan, making MD in 2018. He assumed his role as equity derivatives tech head following the departure of Peter Jepson to Citi in 2021. Pre-JPMorgan, Weisberg was a director of electronic liquidity trading at Barclays, and also worked as a high-frequency trader </news/high-frequency-trading-hiring-and-pay> at now-defunct hedge fund </news/best-place-to-work-hedge-fund> Scout Capital. 

Jefferies, with the addition of Weisberg, has hired multiple MDs </news/jefferies-hires-top-hong-kong-industrials-banker-from-hsbc> already in 2026, after supposedly hiring just five externally </news/jefferies-md-hiring> over the entirety of 2025. Perhaps the bank is swinging the pendulum in the opposite direction, having previously been known as a bank big on external hiring.  </news/2023/10/jefferies-hiring>

Perhaps, instead, the bank is capitalizing on opportunities for disgruntled bank staff post-bonuses </news/it-s-bonus-week-at-jefferies-i-am-told-it-has-been-a-great-year> before returning to its new normal. Given the excellent performance of JPMorgan's equities team, Weisberg may have felt deserving of a bigger bonus than was offered.

Jefferies did not respond to a request for comment.

            <description><![CDATA[Part of the skill of management is to know when to give your staff a pat on the back, and when to deliver a somewhat harder blow a bit lower down.  Accompanying Citi’s Q4 results </news/citi-q4-2025>, which appear to have underwhelmed the stock market <https://www.ft.com/content/f3da395f-fff8-40d4-860e-c39593dd97d6>, CEO Jane Fraser has sent out an all-employees memo <https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-jane-fraser-memo-old-habits-performance-job-cuts-transformation-2026-1> which seems to have a bit more stick than carrot to it.

She lays it on the line; now that the job cuts </news/citi-job-cuts-2026-bonuses> and transformation programs are coming to an end, Citi needs to be driving revenue growth.  And in a world in which domestic retail banking is now the focus of regulation <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/wall-street-scrambles-to-defuse-trump-s-credit-card-onslaught>, it’s hard not to see these words as directed mainly toward the investment bank:

“Every one of us has to adopt a more commercial mindset: asking for the business, competing for the full wallet, and not settling for a secondary role or missed opportunity. We are not graded on effort. We are judged on our results. And I expect to see the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away, and a more disciplined, more confident, winning Citi fully emerge in 2026”

This presumably doesn’t mean that Citi will literally turn down secondary roles in transactions, but Vis Raghavan’s high profile hires are generally accustomed to being in the top left-hand corner of prospectuses, and Fraser seems to be putting them on notice that they are expected to deliver the goods. 

Straight talking like this often works in investment banking – we’re reminded of Jim DeMare’s </news/2023/08/jim-demare-bank-of-america> famous “anyone who doesn’t have the ambition to do better ought to think about working somewhere else” speech, which is credited by many for beginning the turnaround in Bank of America’s fixed income trading franchise.  But they have to be backed up with action.

So far, Fraser has been good at giving Vis Raghavan the budget that he needs to transform the investment bank.  And she has said that “We're going to continue to bring in top talent to fill in remaining gaps”, in response to a question on the earnings call.  But Citi is still under pressure to keep costs down, and CFO Mark Mason has indicated that the aim is to “improve productivity and tools like AI” so as to bring down the overall headcount number.

Bankers can’t really be asked to give their whole attention to the client’s wallet if they’re not secure in their jobs.  It's not easy to keep both eyes on the prize while simultaneously looking over your shoulder.  And there are plenty of outstanding risks which might affect investment banking revenues next year in ways that have nothing to do with the diligence or hunger of its bankers.  So if Jane Fraser really wants Citi staff to give up their bad habits, maybe the top management team should make their own New Year’s resolution to give up the worst habit of all – that of trying to manage market cycles by cutting headcount.

Elsewhere, up until now it has been absolutely verboten to use LLMs in the interview process for most banking jobs.  Goldman Sachs sent out a special warning </news/goldman-hirevue> to candidates about the practice last year, for example.  But, the consultants at McKinsey <https://www.ft.com/content/de7855f0-f586-4708-a8ed-f0458eb25586> asked themselves, if you’re going to be using chatbots all the time in the actual job, shouldn’t you be tested on your ability to do so in the interview?  And so, wannabe McKinseyites will be put through an exercise in using “Lilli”, the firm’s propriety AI “vibe-consulting” tool during their selection process. 

McKinsey seems to be the most committed of the big consultancies to AI – they were given a special award <https://techtorque.com.au/ai-adoption-vs-transformation-what-works/> by OpenAI for the most tokens used last year. It doesn’t necessarily seem to have helped them all that much <https://www.economist.com/business/2025/08/03/how-mckinsey-lost-its-edge>, but they’re still seen as having quite a bit of thought leadership.  So we should probably expect to see the other consultancies follow suit pretty soon, and then possibly the banking industry.

Meanwhile …

Representatives of the City of London are beginning a hand-holding campaign to try and communicate to nervous foreign bankers who spend too much time on social media that a lot of the AI-generated videos they see about London being a violent, chaotic and dangerous place are not necessarily accurate reflections of reality. (FT <https://www.ft.com/content/62855eb0-531a-42f6-b53d-6e286e7833f2>)

But Deutsche Bank’s Claudio De Sanctis thinks that the really rich aren’t scaredy cats.  He says that “My expectation is that a lot of these families that are moving will still look at London as the place where they want to have their banker, given its international scope and their international needs” and plans to specifically target the UK in his latest hiring push to add 250 more high-net worth advisors. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/deutsche-bank-eyes-uk-hiring-drive-to-monetize-wealth-turmoil?embedded-checkout=true>)

American middle market specialist Lincoln International has been quietly ramping up its European presence with 18 managing director hires and a couple of acquisitions over the last year or so.  Now it seems to be reaching the kind of inflection point where long-term rainmakers start leaving for new challenges – Alex Masters, co-head of European consumer coverage is going after eight years at the firm. (Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/lincoln-internationals-co-head-of-european-consumer-dealmaking-masters-departs-e4697904?mod=topic_news>)

Odey Asset Management, once a force in the market before its founder’s euphemistic “fall from grace”, has bowed to the inevitable and will cease trading. Odey himself continues to deny the allegations and has an outstanding libel suit or two. (FT <https://www.ft.com/content/c3629370-3871-4afb-95b6-56ec9f8e3844>)

You can now get high-speed internet for a private jet, allowing CEOs to dial into Zoom calls from the air, and employees on those calls to ask themselves “didn’t someone say we all needed to be back together in the office?” (NY Post <https://nypost.com/2026/01/09/business/starlink-is-turning-private-jets-into-flying-offices/>)

If you have absolutely painstaking attention to detail, don’t mind constant frustration and are prepared to go through a long and annoying apprenticeship with someone regularly telling you that your work isn’t good enough, then instead of being a junior banker, you could become a craft engraver at America’s oldest stationary firm. It only pays $60,000 a year, though.

            <title>How to write a top CV for graduate consulting jobs at Bain, McKinsey and the Big Four</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/graduate-consulting-cv-template</link>
            <media:content url="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/jCO4igNDSnadYji5EJfR" medium="image"></media:content>
            <description><![CDATA[With AI shaking up the recruiting landscape for consultants </news/pay-mckinsey-bain-bcg-big-four>, it's harder than ever to get in on the ground floor through the graduate programs of the major firms. A great CV </news/the-absolutely-perfect-investment-banking-cv> is important, but what does it actually look like?

A new consulting CV template <https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa28wUEptV2dORjBIeDRkeXhwdU5xQUxKRk9mUXxBQ3Jtc0trR3pkUENsTHFxRFF1M2dJSHBxMUp2c0ZRMXNPMXBlM3huZXhxWlhncENjUGlYeGxkTThGS1Z5V2ZFbEljcHRheHFiWE51Mnh3WXJteFlQWEJGUU1RVllLbUVWQ2pER3VLU3JnTXNEdnlvZkNPVFh0Zw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fform.typeform.com%2Fto%2FkWe6l0UI&v=lziLEt4DaZA> has been released by Jack Kim, a former consultant that worked in Bain </news/finance/day-in-the-life-of-a-consultant-at-bain-company>'s recruiting team and also worked on developing the CV scoring matrix at EY Parthenon. In a YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lziLEt4DaZA> video discussing the template and other CV tips, he said that "95% of candidates will not make it past the CV screening stage </news/chat-gpt-write-cv-finance>," so structuring it well is vital.

Kim splits the perfect CV into four sections, two of which are large and two are smaller:

Education (small) is at the top, listed in reverse chronological order. Put your school, subject and expected/achieved grades. Include your A-levels (or equivalent qualifications), and what grades you achieved in them. While you can include relevant modules or subjects from your degree, Kim said he "rarely looked at these... it's not going to move the needle that much."

The next and "probably the most important" section is Work Experience (large). Include relevant work experience, starting with the most recent. Include your job title, name of employer, the location you worked, and the period of employment. 

You'll then have to bullet point some of your key responsibilities and achievements in each role. Kim said that consultants are looking for six specific things: "analytical skills, leadership skills, communication skills, stakeholder management skills, problem-solving skills, and teamwork." The specifics will vary from firm to firm; Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ai-is-changing-consulting-talent-at-mckinsey-pwc-deloitte-2025-12> reported last month that McKinsey, for example, screens its CVs with a focus on conceptual thinkers and quick learners. The best way to demonstrate your impact is by quantifying actions </news/finance/29-power-words-will-invigorate-investment-banking-cv>, which can be done by utilizing the S.T.A.R Method (situation, task, action result).  </news/finance/the-s-t-a-r-interview-technique>

If you have too much experience to fit on one page, pick a handful of the most relevant for the specific roles. Too many entries "doesn't tell much of a story." </news/getting-a-job-at-goldman-sachs>

After that, Kim has a section on Extracurriculars and Leadership Roles (large). This section is a similar size to work experience and uses similar principles, but is for "any external projects that you've done." This section should include, where possible, leadership positions in university societies and sports teams. </news/best-sport-for-hedge-fund-job> This section looks most impressive when there's a lot of variation between your side-projects; Kim said "consulting firms love overachievers who are good at everything and can balance multiple things."

Kim noted that it's also important to provide broader context around these achievements where necessary, such as the size of a university society. "Being a treasurer of an investment society with 1,000 members is more impressive than being president of a Korean society with just 20."

While not explicitly mentioned by Kim, this is also the space to put any tech projects (presumably vibe-coded </news/robinhood-ai-coding>), given the increased demand for AI-literate </news/how-to-get-a-banking-ai-job> consultants. Senior McKinsey partner Alex Singla told Business Insider the firm wants to find candidates who are capable of being elite technologists, or elite consultants, then "groom them to be both."

The final section of the CV is for Skills and Interests (small) and acts as "more of a conversation starter" than anything. When applying to one consultancy, Kim included his involvement with the London School of Economics' </news/target-universities-finance-uk> League of Legends team in this section, which led to a 30-minute conversation with a senior partner about the video game </news/2023/03/video-game-software-developer-hedge-fund-high-frequency-trading>. You should include relevant certifications here, too, but don't go overboard; "you want to make sure you're maximizing the space on work experience or extracurriculars," Kim said. 

Other housekeeping tips Kim gave for the CV include: 


Use Arial font, sized between 10 and 12pt.
"Make sure that the bullet points and spacing are perfectly aligned... I cannot stress that enough."
Keep your CV to one page.


How is a consulting CV different to an investment banking CV?

If you're applying to jobs in consulting, you've likely also considered a career in investment banking </news/consultants-leaving-for-investment-banking>. If you're applying to both, </news/finance/working-for-mckinsey-bain-and-boston-consulting-vs-goldman-jpm-and-morgan-stanley> will the same CV work? Perhaps not as effectively. 

Speaking to students in 2023, Goldman Sachs recruiters gave an example of their perfect CV, visible here. </news/2023/02/goldman-sachs-cv-template> Goldman also separates its CV into four sections, but the work experience section is first, and takes up more than half the page. It's followed by education, then leadership roles, both of which are roughly the same size. The fourth section, additional information, is the smallest, and is tacked on at the end. 

There are similarities. Goldman is looking for consistency in the presentation of the CV, and also told students to quantify their achievements. One bullet point for an analyst role in the sample CV read: "Performed M&A screen for $20bn client, designed 7 quantitative screen criteria and ranked 30 potential targets."

Whether you're applying to a bank or a consultancy, tailoring the content of your CV </news/2022/11/what-not-to-put-banking-cv#:~:text=You%E2%80%99re%20not%20making,essential%2C%E2%80%9D%20Victoria%20says.> to the role itself is fundamental. If you have the time to go the extra mile and tailor the formatting too, it could make a difference.]]></description>

It’s been a while since the bank discussed how many applicants per role it received, but the last time we had figures </news/2022/05/citi-malaga> (in 2022), it was well over 300 applicants per open role. That tracks with what we know about other applications to other investment banks such as Goldman Sachs </news/2023/02/goldman-sachs-acceptance-rate>.

Getting a job offer against so much competition is very tough, and you’ll need every asset at your disposal – from the perfect CV </news/the-absolutely-perfect-investment-banking-cv> to extensive knowledge of what HireVue interviews are </news/how-long-to-answer-hirevue-interview> and how they work </news/2022/10/hirevue-interview-banking>. 

Luckily, if you’re looking for interview questions, you’ve done the hard work, and the ball is firmly in your court. The interview is usually one of, if not the last step in getting an investment banking job. But falling at the last hurdle is still possible – you’ll want to be prepared. And the best way to be prepared is to know what questions you will be asked.

We’ve pulled the questions below from a variety of sources, including Glassdoor, WallStreetOasis, and Reddit.

And they’re all for people who interviewed with Citi in the last six months – regardless of whether they were successful or not.

It’s been a while since the bank discussed how many applicants per role it received, but the last time we had figures </news/2022/05/citi-malaga> (in 2022), it was well over 300 applicants per open role. That tracks with what we know about other applications to other investment banks such as Goldman Sachs </news/2023/02/goldman-sachs-acceptance-rate>.

Getting a job offer against so much competition is very tough, and you’ll need every asset at your disposal – from the perfect CV </news/the-absolutely-perfect-investment-banking-cv> to extensive knowledge of what HireVue interviews are </news/how-long-to-answer-hirevue-interview> and how they work </news/2022/10/hirevue-interview-banking>. 

Luckily, if you’re looking for interview questions, you’ve done the hard work, and the ball is firmly in your court. The interview is usually one of, if not the last step in getting an investment banking job. But falling at the last hurdle is still possible – you’ll want to be prepared. And the best way to be prepared is to know what questions you will be asked.

We’ve pulled the questions below from a variety of sources, including Glassdoor, WallStreetOasis, and Reddit. They’re overwhelmingly (but not exclusively) questions asked of junior applicants such as summer interns. And they’re all for people who interviewed with Citi in the last six months – regardless of whether they were successful or not.

            <title>Citi’s traders had an awful Q4, although its bankers did a bit better</title>

            <description><![CDATA[It’s Q4 reporting season for America’s big banks. JPMorgan </news/jpmorgan-q4-2025>’s bankers didn’t do great, but its traders did okay. Neither did Bank of America </news/bank-of-america-s-credit-trading-turnaround-slow-to-start-after-leadership-changes>’s bankers, but again, its traders earned their stripes. Citi announced its results <https://www.citigroup.com/global/investors/quarterly-earnings> today, and while its bankers didn’t do so badly, its traders didn't exactly match their peers.

Equities traders </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank> seem to be the guilty party. Q4 revenue in 2025 was down 1.3% on 2024, at a time when rivals JPMorgan and Bank of America posted results 40% and 23%, respectively.

The bank did note that the fall was “primarily” offset by a growth in prime services and derivatives, with the former being an especially key market – the bank brought in Adam Inzirillo </news/adam-inzirillo-citi> for it in September last year, which is probably not enough time to make a significant impact on the business. Speaking in March 2024, markets chief Andrew Morton said that the firm’s strategy was simple: “grow prime”.

Its fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) didn’t do much better, but poor results were obfuscated by similar performances from its rivals. Sales & trading revenue was down in the fourth quarter by 0.6%, while JPMorgan and Bank of America posted upswings of 7.5% and 1.6% respectively. 

Investment banking </news/the-investment-banking-recruitment-process> had a more positive outlook. M&A bankers had a wild 84% revenue upswing in the fourth quarter, at a time when both JPMorgan and Bank of America posted relatively flat results. In capital markets, its equity capital markets revenue fell by 16% (less than JPM or BofA) and its debt capital markets revenue managed to increase by 19%, while JPM and BofA were negative and flat, respectively.

Citi is cutting </news/citi-job-cuts-2026-bonuses>. Earlier this week, it became clear that it was putting 1,000 people on the chopping block this week alone, as part of the bank’s planned 20,000 cuts by the end of 2026. We were told before Christmas that the cuts would primarily target underperforming Managing Directors, saving money on their usually quite juicy bonuses.

Baris 'Chico' Temelkuran </news/2021/08/baris-temelkuran-bnp-paribas>, former global head of FX options trading </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank> at BNP Paribas, has reemerged after a four and a half year sabbatical. He's joining hedge fund </news/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job> ExodusPoint as a macro portfolio manager, based in London.

He spent three years at BNP, during which the bank won Risk.net's currency derivatives house of the year  <https://www.risk.net/awards/7741371/currency-derivatives-house-of-the-year-bnp-paribas>award in 2021. BNP did not comment at the time of his departure, but sources suggested his exit may not have been entirely voluntary. Before BNP, Chico made his name at Goldman Sachs; he spent 12 years at the bank, joining in 2006 and achieving promotion to MD in 2014. 

Chico may be filling some gaps left by macro portfolio managers being relocated to Dubai.  </news/london-to-dubai-hedge-fund-jobs-exoduspoint>Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/exoduspoint-boosts-macro-team-in-dubai-relocates-portfolio-managers-from-london-512f4ba0> reported that Driss Mokeddem and James Clarke both relocated there in the latter half of last year.

ExodusPoint </news/exoduspoint-london-pay> pays very well in London. Its most recent yearly accounts via Companies House (for 2024) show that it paid an average of $1.1m for its 110 employees. It had 15 members in its LP, and earned profits equivalent to $9.5m per member. The situation may be even better today; ExodusPoint had an excellent year, returning 18% globally <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/hedge-funds-turn-chaos-into-cash-for-best-gains-in-16-years> in 2025.

ExodusPoint did not respond to a request for comment.

            <description><![CDATA[Bank of America's macro traders </news/bofa-q2-2025> were the stars of its markets business in the first half of 2025, as FICC trading </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank> revenues rose by 12% year-on-year. The success of BofA's FICC team waned towards the end of the year, but macro traders don't appear to be the culprits.

In Q4, Bank of America's FICC revenues increased a mere 1.58% year-on-year. Aided by a similarly underwhelming Q3, </news/bofa-q3-2025#:~:text=Its%20Q3%20fixed%20income%2C%20currencies%2C%20and%20commodities%20(FICC)%20revenue%20was%20just%205%25%20above%20the%20figure%20from%20Q3%20of%20last%20year%20%E2%80%93%20a%20performance%20worse%20than%20any%20of%20its%20peers.%C2%A0> this dropped the increase in yearly FICC revenues to 7.88% in 2025. JPMorgan, by contrast, had a double-digit revenue increase of 12.29% in FICC for the year. Despite petering out at the end, BofA's presentation said the FICC team's marginal revenue increase was "driven by improved performance in macro products." 

The macro team also increased its proportion of total yearly FICC revenues from 55% in 2024 to 58% to 2025. Credit wasn't doing particularly well at the start of the year, with revenues down 2.5% year-on-year in H1, and the implication is that the last few months have been similarly challenging. 

BofA notably restructured its markets business in November </news/bank-of-america-s-new-structure-highlights-the-importance-of-sales-guys> after its previous head of markets Jim DeMare </news/2023/08/bank-of-america-culture> was promoted to co-president. Matt McQueen, an MD of 17 years at BofA, was made global head of micro products, including credit, mortgages and municipals. BofA's previous head of credit trading, Brian Carosielli, was promoted into a pure sales role; he now runs all sales within BofA's global markets team. There doesn't appear to have been an instant turnaround under McQueen, but the next quarter (his first full one in the role) might be a better indicator of progress. 

The bank's equities team had a more triumphant end to the year; revenues were up 23% year-on-year in Q4, bringing the increase in total yearly revenues to 15.71% in 2025. The bank credited its equities success to "increased client activity," which may have something to do with DeMare's replacements at the top of the markets division both being former sales guys.

            <description><![CDATA[There are few investments that you could realistically call 'the deal of the century' but a pre-seed investment in digibank Revolut </news/revolut-s-new-office-gives-for-free-what-jp-morgan-bankers-have-to-pay-for> is a serious contender. VC firm </news/how-to-get-a-job-in-venture-capital> Balderton Capital did just that in 2015, turning a £1m investment into billions, and there's one person in particular that it has to thank.

The FT <https://www.ft.com/content/97e6f29e-bc79-43e0-bcbd-2dfe98755ea3> reported this week that Tim Bunting, a former Goldman Sachs partner, </news/partner-at-goldman-sachs> sourced the Revolut investment for Balderton. Balderton joined the VC back in 2007 after 18 years at Goldman, where he was most notably vice chairman of its European business, Goldman Sachs International.  </news/goldman-sachs-london>

Bunting participated in other Balderton successes too. Balderton's website says he was involved in a 2014 series B investment in payments fintech GoCardless </news/fintech-jobs-bureaucratic#:~:text=Yesterday%27s%20unicorn%20is,valuations%20in%202022.> at an undisclosed valuation; it ballooned in value to $2.1bn in 2022 but was recently acquired by another fintech, Mollie, for ~$1.1bn. <https://www.fintechfutures.com/m-a/mollie-acquires-gocardless> 

Unsurprisingly, perhaps given his successes, Bunting has retired from Balderton. Bunting was one of the partners in Balderton's LLP between 2007 and 2021, which meant he was a part of its seemingly lucrative profit sharing scheme. Accounts via Companies House show that, in 2015, (the year Balderton invested in Revolut) it paid an average of £945k each to its seven members via profit sharing. The highest paid member, presumably managing partner Bernard Liautaud, earned  £2.7m that year, which meant the average pay for partners excluding him was closer to £656k. In 2021, Bunting's last year as a partner, Balderton paid an average of £1.43m to its members, excluding the highest paid one. 

Bunting and Balderton Capital did not respond to a request for comment.

            <title>Morning Coffee: JPMorgan&#39;s fastest rising competitor isn&#39;t Citi.  The former Evercore banker who’s the new coolest man on the ski slopes</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/jpmorgan-dcm-citi-morgan-stanley</link>

            <description><![CDATA[By their own high standards (and those of the analysts that follow them), JPMorgan’s results announced yesterday were a little bit disappointing <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/jpmorgan-investment-banking-fees-drop-on-debt-underwriting-miss?embedded-checkout=true>.  Sales and trading revenues were very strong </news/jpmorgan-q4-2025>, but banking fees weren’t, missing guidance that the company had provided only a short while ago.

Debt capital markets appears to have been the problem, where according to Dealogic <https://dealogic.com/investment-banking-scorecard/>, JPMorgan seems to have shed some market share. Although JPM retained its position at the top of the league table, with bookrunner position on $572bn of deals, this was actually a smaller amount than in 2024, despite the total volume increasing by nearly 8%.

Since the second placed player in the DCM league table was Citi, it might be natural to assume that what we’re seeing here is the “Vis Raghavan effect”.  Citi’s head of investment banking spent a lot of 2025 </news/jpmorgan-to-citi> hiring former colleagues from JPMorgan, and after a while a bank which keeps losing bankers is going to start losing deals. But on a closer look, this doesn’t seem so likely.

Citi hired Rob Cascarino </news/now-citi-hired-jp-morgan-s-former-global-co-head-of-sponsors-private-side-sales> from JPMorgan in August to be co-head </news/citi-has-a-lot-of-new-co-heads-for-a-bank-that-doesn-t-like-them> of European DCM, but there don’t seem to have been many other hires in this area.  If you look back at Raghavan’s hiring in 2025, it seems to have been more skewed toward the equity capital markets, M&A </news/guillermo-baygual> and coverage teams. 

And Citi don’t actually seem to have been the ones taking market share this year, in any case. They held their position, growing revenue almost exactly in line with the market.  That might have been considered quite a good result, given the amount of turnover </news/citi-needs-new-dcm-bankers-after-goldman-sachs-curious-hire> on their DCM team, including the loss of three or four MDs half way through the year.

So if Citi hasn’t gained market share and hasn’t been hiring much from JPM, we can conclude that this isn’t the source of the problem.  What was? 

According to the Dealogic table, the big market share gainer was Morgan Stanley, which grew its deal volume by 17.5% nearly twice as fast as the market.  That doesn’t necessarily translate directly into revenue – league table credit is given to bookrunners, but other underwriting positions also pay money, and not every deal is equal in terms of fees paid.  But when combined with Morgan Stanley’s traditional strength in the Technology sector, it gives us a clue what’s been going on.

In the fourth quarter, a lot of debt deals for datacenters closed; enough to make a difference to the global revenue figures and the league tables.  If Morgan Stanley won a lot of those deals, and JPMorgan was shut out, then that might go some of the way to explaining why one bank surprised on the upside and the other on the downside.  People matter a lot for market share, but sometimes the most important thing is just to have the right sectoral positioning at the right time.

Elsewhere, leaving a blue chip boutique like Evercore in order to start up your own boutique might be considered a career risk.  Leaving the investment banking industry entirely to concentrate on “geopolitical risk advisory” adds a bit more.  But to concentrate your offering on a country that’s something of a global pariah, subject to sanctions and experiencing hyperinflation … that’s truly courageous. Until it pays off <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/venezuela-insider-charles-myers-fields-wall-street-s-calls-from-aspen-slopes>.

So Charles Myers, of Signum Global Advisors, has had the kind of defining career experience that not many bankers get – he’s taken calls from clients that were so desperate to talk to him about developments in Venezuela that they couldn’t wait until he reached the end of the chair lift in Aspen.  After slaloming back down (and perhaps knocking back a restorative gluhwein), he has started to organise a trip to the country to look for investment opportunities “post-Maduro”, with fifty clients already expressing an interest in paying to come along, although he plans to cap the numbers at half that.

This seems to be the nature of global risk advisory – most of the time, it’s a relatively calm analytical job, pumping out punditry for a smallish client base that’s prepared to pay a retainer to be kept in the loop.  Then once in a while, some of the potential geopolitical risk turns into actual geopolitical news, and people can’t get enough of you.  It is, as the proverb goes, an ill wind that doesn’t blow a banker somewhere good.

Meanwhile …

JPMorgan wants someone to replace Kaustubh Kulkarni, the head of its Indian operations who left last year to go to Citi.  And with the Indian IPO market continuing to heat up, it’s prepared to pay top dollar to get the best.  Apparently local CEO of Goldman Sachs has been approached but has ruled himself out. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/jpmorgan-weighs-top-rival-bankers-to-lead-india-expansion-drive?embedded-checkout=true>)

If any of your London colleagues seem sluggish or distracted, it might be because a change to the prescribing rules have made it quite a lot more difficult for some people with ADHD to get prescriptions. (FT <https://www.ft.com/content/5f56169d-5815-4b1a-9c6b-511533b8eb1f>)

BlackRock is starting a small round of job cuts, with around 250 investment and distribution professionals (1% of the global workforce) likely to be made redundant early this year. (Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/blackrock-slashes-another-250-jobs-fef69c2b?utm_sf_cserv_ref=19643448&utm_sf_post_ref=650587347>)

“Internal tensions over desk availability and parking spaces” may be coming to an end at JPMorgan; without increasing its real estate footprint too much, the bank is planning some “de-densification and catching up on space renovations around the world” to “provide employees a reasonable in-office experience” to match the flagship head office. (Business Insider <https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-will-upgrade-offices-growing-workforce-2026-1>)

SocGen’s joint venture with Bernstein will be cutting a third of its French headcount. (Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/socgen-s-bernstein-jv-seeks-to-cut-france-workforce-by-third>)

They say that the best way to rob a bank is to own one, but the second best way might be to take advantage of the Christmas break to drill through a wall in a small German town and empty 3,250 safe-deposit boxes.  The thieves have left behind “cash, documents, watches and silver bars” and presumably got away with a lot more – currently estimated at tens of millions of euros (FT <https://www.ft.com/content/b94c35ec-a743-44c2-9847-79145a15c754>)

            <title>Citi analyst who burned out aged 24 says she was only in it for the money</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Burnout </news/experienced-traders-impart-advice-to-exhausted-juniors-burnout-it-s-been-four-days> is a well-known problem in banking. In between the long hours </news/working-hours-banks> and the genuinely unfulfilling work, it’s easy to ask: what’s this all for?

Speaking to Lazo Cetnik, CEO of Pretraga Partners, on the Merger Talks podcast <https://www.pretragapartners.com/about-5>, former Citi investment banking analyst Vitoria Okuyama was frank about what brought her to finance. “When I was 17,” she recalled, “I qualified for the US Open, and I couldn't go. Because I didn't have the money.”

She was never the same after that. “I always had the motivation that I never wanted money to stop me from doing anything again,” she explained. “When I heard about investment banking, at the time, it was the highest paying job that I knew of. It was a no-brainer. I didn’t care about what I had to do or what it looked like,” she said. “It was definitely the money motivation for me.”

Okuyama was a talented tennis player in her teens, at one point ranking 118th in the world. After lacking the money to progress in tennis, banking seemed the only way forward. 

“The hours were pretty brutal,” she said. “I was working from 10am to 10pm for months in a row.” Burnout came not too long after. After a brief holiday back home in Brazil for carnival she faced a particularly brutal patch of work – “three months in a row, from 10am until 4am every day” – which she began hours after taking a red eye flight. 

For Okuyama, burnout meant aggression against those close to you, confusion about your own behavior, and eventually panic attacks. She was like a frog in hot water. “The main thing I should have done was taken time out earlier. I realized that I never fully recovered until I took time off,” she said. “When you cross that line, you cannot just go back to normal. You truly need to stop and recover, and it’s easier to repair than to rebuild.”

As we’ve noted before <https://efinancialcareers.com/news/burnout-banking-ayahuasca>, Okuyama’s recovery process eventually took her to Peru and involved yoga and Ayahuasca. She was eventually refused promotion to associate <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitoriaokuyama_why-did-you-quit-investment-banking-at-citi-activity-7415044742373289984-F6GJ/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD3MKIoBz6uL_-T9BN8KyzCNi5j5Yyi8Rbc> and became an influencer. Maybe she will make a lot of money there instead.

            <title>JPMorgan is spending $9bn but still has a bias against hiring new people</title>
            <link>https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/jpmorgan-hiring-2026</link>

            <description><![CDATA[When JPMorgan revealed late last year that its expenses would rise by $9bn in 2026, its shares fell by nearly 5%.  <https://www.ft.com/content/52566296-350d-4324-a978-51e99601870a#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20shares%20had%20their,more%20than%20%249bn%20next%20year.>Announcing fourth quarter results  </news/jpmorgan-q4-2025>today, the bank reiterated its intention to spend the additional money, but suggested it may not go to people.

Speaking today, JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum, said the bank spent 2025 becoming accustomed to "living within its means." - "When someone wants to get something done, we want to ensure that their first reaction is not 'hire more people,'" he added.

Barnum said much the same thing  </news/goldman-sachs-cutting-2025>in October, implying that the no-hiring approach has inveigled its way into the bank's culture. 

What will this year's extra $9bn be spent on? In October, Marianne Lake </news/marianne-lake> said it will go towards branches, marketing, the credit card business, advisors' bonuses in wealth management and, AI.

Today, Barnum said the bank is "allowing ourselves to at least plan for some additional hiring in technology to support long term investment initiatives," and said that this includes AI. CEO Jamie Dimon said JPMorgan has to invest in AI simply to keep up with competitors like Stripe. Successful investments don't lead to additional points of profit margin, but must be endlessly reinvested, said Dimon. JPMorgan isn't so focused on meeting expense targets that it will be left behind, Dimon observed. 

Alongside technology staff, Barnum said JPMorgan will spend this year hiring more advisors and private banker.  Conor Hillery, head of investment banking for EMEA at the bank also told Financial News <https://www.fnlondon.com/amp/articles/jpmorgan-emea-dealmaking-boss-looks-to-middle-east-emerging-markets-for-growth-5e5d31a4> that he intends to hire additional bankers in the Middle East, irrespective of the state of the market.

Last year, JPMorgan increased overall compensation spending by 6% and spending on technology, communications and equipment by 12%. Net headcount increased by 1,289 people, to 318,512. Barnum noted that headcount increased rapidly during the pandemic. In 2022, for example, JPMorgan added 20,000 people.

            <description><![CDATA[Q4 reporting season for the big American banks has begun, as is tradition, with JPMorgan <https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/quarterly-earnings>. The bank as a whole did decently – but within the corporate and investment bank (CIB), some businesses did not.

It wasn’t all bad news. Sales & trading </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank> revenues across both equities and fixed income, currencies, and commodities were up for 2025 vs 2024, by 33% and 12% respectively. That was driven by a particularly strong fourth quarter, in which the equities team posted revenue 40% higher than the same period of 2024. Within equities, JPMorgan said prime broking revenues were particularly strong. 

When bonuses at the bank are announced next week </news/goldman-sachs-bonuses-are-announced-thursday-jp-morgan-people-must-wait>, JPMorgan's equities traders may therefore have something to celebrate. Compensation in the CIB rose by 6.3% overall across 2025, with the average pay per person going from $195k to $205k. 

Bonuses are likely to be less buoyant for JPMorgan's investment bankers. JPMorgan's M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs>, Equity Capital Markets </news/capital-markets-jobs-ecm-and-dcm> (ECM) and Debt Capital Markets (DCM) revenues were all down in the fourth quarter – by 3%, 16%, and 2% respectively.

Although the fall in DCM was no doubt a disappointment, it was far from unexpected. Dealogic says JPMorgan worked on fewer DCM deals by value than other banks in 2025, even while the market as a whole increased in volume by 8%. 

Similarly, JPMorgan’s full-year 2025 revenue was up just 2% on 2024, despite global issuances growing by over 20% (and JPMorgan’s market share also increasing, according to Dealogic). Quarter-on-quarter ECM revenue was down 16% in Q4 of 2025 compared to 2024.

            <description><![CDATA[It's not just Citi.  </news/citi-job-cuts-2026-bonuses>UBS's intention to cut jobs in early 2026 has also been well-flagged </news/ubs-layoffs-credit-suisse>. And those cuts are also approaching.

Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/ermotti-flags-job-cuts-as-ubs-nears-credit-suisse-integration?utm_medium=email&utm_source=author_alert&utm_term=260113&utm_campaign=author_21003048> reports that UBS will start a new round of job cuts "soon" and implies that they may afflict technology staff more than others. UBS says it's still running two separate IT systems in Switzerland (UBS's and Credit Suisse's) and that it intends to shut one and create "synergies". 

Up to 3,000 jobs will go as a result. The timeline for their disappearance is between now and early 2027.

Coincidentally or not, the cuts follow the disappearance of Mike Dargan, UBS's former group COO and chief technology officer, who left at the end of December for digital bank N26. 

Dargan, who spent nine years at UBS after joining from Standard Chartered, was assigned one of the Swiss bank's most stressful jobs </news/mike-dargan-ubs> after the Credit Suisse acquisition. It included moving 1.3m Credit Suisse customers with 110 petabytes of data are involved onto the UBS platform while also closing 3,000 Credit Suisse applications and 40,000 Credit Suisse servers. 

With the Credit Suisse system seemingly being shut down, it appears that neither Dargan nor some members of his team are now required. This should be no surprise: even in 2023, UBS said it planned to close 90% of Credit Suisse's IT applications.   </news/2023/08/credit-suisse-tech-jobs-ubs>

IT people may not be the only ones cut, though. UBS declined to comment on the cuts when we inquired last week, but sources at the bank have suggested the cuts may be cross department and impact 15% of some teams. 

UBS announces bonuses in mid-February </news/investment-banking-bonus-schedule-calendar>, so anyone let go soon will go without a bonus. It's thought that this year's bonus pool at the bank may not be the best.

Jennie Xue, formerly a senior MD for medical devices investment banking at Guggenheim, is now joining Goldman Sachs in New York as an MD. A memo from the bank seen by eFinancialCareers said Xue will be working in the bank's cross markets group on medical technology banking. FINRA's BrokerCheck tools shows that her last day at Guggenheim was last Friday after 10 and a half years with the bank, six of which were as an MD.

Xue isn't the only recent departure from Guggenheim in 2026. Evercore announced last week that it hired Chris Macios, another senior MD within Guggenheim's middle market financial sponsors coverage group. 

Guggenheim Securities brought some big names in M&A  </news/guggenheim-m-and-a-bankers>during the latter half of last year that may compensate for its exits. It hired aerospace and defence banker Michael Richter from Lazard in September and industrials banker Steve 'Elvis' Edelman in November.

            <description><![CDATA[The world’s electronic trading firms might seem similar on the outside, but they have some very different specialities </news/difference-between-electronic-trading-firms>. Despite that, or maybe because of it, they love hiring from each other.

Lawrence Hume joined Dutch HFT firm Flow Traders this week as global head of its cash equities & tokenized trading team, based in London. He joined the firm from Chicago-based rival DRW, where he spent four years, and where he was head of European equity volatility trading.

Hume spent years bouncing around London’s banks before switching to market makers. He moved from Merrill Lynch to Goldman Sachs </news/2014/08/goldman-sachs-jobs-suddenly-filled-outsiders-bank-america> after just two years at the former, and nine months at the latter before quitting for Morgan Stanley </news/2015/03/7-interesting-people-hired-by-goldman-sachs-baml-and-morgan-stanley-in-march-and-what-they-mean-for-you>, where he ended up staying for more than six years.

Flow Traders hasn’t released its Q4/FY results for 2025 yet, but it had a pretty bad Q3. “Variable employee expenses”, a proxy for bonuses, halved in Q3 of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. They were still up for the year including the first two quarters, but it’s a bad sign.

            <description><![CDATA[Last week, Morgan Stanley promoted some new managing directors.  </news/morgan-stanley-s-2026-md-list-ai-experts-ex-hedge-fund-traders>However, it also promoted some new vice presidents (VPs). In New York, they included a new young VP who not so long ago was working on a sheep farm in Scotland.

Aged 25, Scott Ritchie is working in financial control, planning and analysis for Morgan Stanley in NYC. Aged 22, he was working part-time for a sheep farm in Bishopston, a small village in Scotland, after completing a finance apprenticeship at Morgan Stanley in Glasgow.

Morgan Stanley declined to comment for this article and Ritchie didn't respond to a request to comment, but his success looks like an advertisement both for apprenticeships </news/2022/02/apprenticeships-banks> and for jobs in the middle office.  </news/finance/front-office-middle-office-back-office-banking>

It's understood that Ritchie left his local Scottish high school aged 16. Writing on LinkedIn, he says spent nine years working part-time on beef and sheep farms between the ages of 13 and 22 and that this shaped his work ethic.  At Morgan Stanley, he was an apprentice for three years before completing the ACCA exams and becoming an analyst in Glasgow. He was promoted to associate aged 21 and then moved to New York aged 23.

There are no sheep or cows in New York, but Ritchie is now working with bigger beasts in the form of Morgan Stanley's US CFO and US Comptroller. His career is thought to have been accelerated by the fact that he was designated a rising star within Morgan Stanley and by the support of Morgan Stanley's former US CFO.

Ritchie's success is a reminder that there is more to banking than M&A </news/what-are-ma-jobs> and sales and trading.  </news/how-do-you-get-a-job-in-sales-and-trading-in-a-bank>It's also a reminder that you don't need direct financial services experience to work your way up in banking, and that sheep farming as well as McDonald's </news/2022/05/100-hour-weeks> can bolster a CV </news/the-absolutely-perfect-investment-banking-cv> if deployed correctly.

            <description><![CDATA[Multiple multistrategy hedge funds </news/best-paying-hedge-funds> are quite fond of traders working at Eisler Capital. Brevan Howard </news/eisler-brevan-howard> is one of them, Balyasny </news/where-do-portfolio-managers-work-balyasny> is another.

Balyasny hired Nikoloaos Rapanos, a portfolio manager at Eisler Capital, for its macro trading team. According to his LinkedIn, he joined the fund last year and is based in London.

Rapanos spent 18 months at Eisler in what was his first fully-fledged PM role. Prior to that, he spent six years at macro hedge fund Caxton Associates as a sub-PM in its global macro team. Rapanos has a PhD in finance and previously worked as an associate at Goldman Sachs.

He's one of many Eisler alums to join Balyasny, which has a thing for Eisler's quant strats. </news/strats-jobs-investment-banks> Last week, we reported on Tibor Kucs </news/eisler-capital-strats-to-balyasny> who joined to lead a team of equities quant  </news/quant-jobs-finance>researchers. 

Other strats have joined as portfolio managers; Alexander Alekseev </news/eisler-capital>, a top systematic equities PM, joined in October to build out a team and took five other Eisler people with him. Rapanos may not have been a strat at Eisler but spent much of his time at Caxton working in quant research.

            <title>Morning Coffee: Citi announces job cuts days before bonuses. Sergio Ermotti wants out at UBS </title>

            <description><![CDATA[If you have a keen memory for news involving Citi, you could deploy it to remember that before Christmas we said  </news/citi-job-cuts-2026>that Citi would be cutting jobs in the New Year. This is now happening, albeit at a small scale. 

Get Morning Coffee  </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>☕ in your inbox. Sign up here. </myefc/preferences/subscribe?newsletter=network_newsletter>

Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/citi-to-cut-about-1-000-jobs-this-week-as-fraser-trims-costs> reports that Citi is planning 1,000 job cuts this week, less than 1% of its 227,000 employees. The bank is saying that: "These changes reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our transformation work.”

While this suggests that the cuts might be about Citi's enthusiasm for AI agents  <https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-agents-arrive-at-citi-60a3559d?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfAXBXM2t-IJmWclHwXocgXIQx8HzcdHwhtCu9I3M28QR-Wda70jWGIZ5PNZHA%3D&gaa_ts=6966050a&gaa_sig=ZTs5HbxTNBAeT8Mns1OAcPTCn9_6TxgPV_o2bc4ZJZZayzVtgo36m3aL8wzYRHEnyG2PhRbid3r--0brB-6ldw%3D%3D>or offshoring,  </news/ill-conceived-offshoring-destroyed-this-bank>our pre-Christmas sources said the bank's post-Christmas cuts would be more about eliminating underperforming managing directors and saving money on their bonuses. 

Given that Citi is expected to announce bonuses </news/banker-bonuses> on Thursday </news/goldman-sachs-bonuses-are-announced-thursday-jp-morgan-people-must-wait> this week, the cuts do indeed seem timed to swap severance packages for performance pay. Citi insiders who fell foul of the bank's notorious forced ranking system during annual reviews tell us they're apprehensive about what comes next. "I've never been ranked this low before," says one. "I think they're planning to push me out." 

Separately, after being persuaded back from the beach by Colm Kelleher to run the combined UBS and Credit Suisse in 2023, Sergio Ermotti will soon return to whence he came. 

The Financial Times <https://www.ft.com/content/0b6e4687-0804-448c-a7c4-155bc6005136> reports that Ermotti plans to step down as CEO of UBS for a second time in April 2027 and that Colm Kelleher is looking for his replacement. 

This should come as no surprise. When Kelleher persuaded Ermotti to come back, Ermotti always said he wouldn't stay forever. “There is a lot of life in him, but he is not as young as some people,” observed Kelleher keenly at the time. <https://www.ft.com/content/b63a2e33-bc11-4059-ab7f-8784daa19674> 

Ermotti, who is 65, does not need the money. When he first retired from UBS </news/2023/11/sergio-ermotti-ubs-124> in 2020, he said </news/2023/03/sergio-ermotti-ubs> he no longer needed to work for cash and was following his passion and holidaying in the Maldives. Last year alone, he earned another $17m.

UBS has long said it would like an internal successor to occupy Ermotti's seat and was said by the FT <https://www.ft.com/content/844cd731-ad33-4556-9bdd-c3a28f95d4ed> in 2024 to be planning a shortlist of three candidates. The FT says the favourite is Aleksandar Ivanovic, the head of asset management, or maybe Iqbal Khan and Robert Karofsky, who co-head wealth. COO Bea Martin is a fourth possibility.

Conor Hillery, head of investment banking for EMEA at JPMorgan, says he's making "selective hires" for his European dealmaking team but is preparing a "big expansion in the Middle East" and "growing in some emerging markets like Turkey and sub-Saharan Africa.” This will happen irrespective of market conditions.

Hedge fund Diameter Partners made money shorting First Brands' senior debt when it was trading in the 90 cent range because it thought it "smelled of fraud." Then it decided it wasn't so smelly and bought the debt for 30 cents on the dollar in the expectation that it would recover. It now trades at 20 cents on the dollar and Diameter has lost $100m. “A mere three months later, and the letters F-B haunt us every time we close our eyes.” (Bloomberg)  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/diameter-s-winning-bet-on-first-brands-turns-horribly-wrong>

When the cap on unfair dismissal payments is removed </news/unlimited-compensation-for-unfair-dismissal-bankers-uk>, banks might stop hiring or fire before it becomes applicable. “We would expect employers to be a lot more ruthless in operating probationary periods and terminating employment before employees reach the six-month mark."

The problem with private equity is the rigidity of commitments made under uncertainty about future public market returns. If an investor wants one third in private equity, one third in stocks, one third in bonds, and private equity is committed last, the amount committed to PE will vary according to the value of the other investments.

London bankers are no longer making money on their houses. 14.8% of London sellers sold for less in 2025 than they originally paid and the problem was particularly acute in the City of London, Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, and Hammersmith and Fulham.

            <description><![CDATA[Last year, Jefferies was vocal about its desire to promote more managing directors (MDs) from within and hire less externally. </news/jefferies-md-hiring> Nonetheless, exceptions are made when necessary, as is the case with the bank's latest hire in Hong Kong. </news/best-university-for-banking-jobs-hong-kong-singapore>

Misi Tang announced via LinkedIn late last week that she is joining Jefferies as its Asia head of diversified industrials, </news/bankers-say-it-s-not-just-baird-most-industrials-teams-are-a-nightmare> based in Hong Kong. Her most recent role appears to be at HSBC; Bloomberg  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/hsbc-is-said-to-hire-misi-tang-from-barclays-to-boost-asia-deals>reported in 2019 that she joined the bank as its APAC head of capital goods and auto coverage. 

Prior to that, Tang spent a decade at Barclays, where she was an MD and China head of Industrials. 

New senior arrivals at Jefferies are becoming increasingly rare after years of being very common. The bank said in its October 2025 investor day <https://ir.jefferies.com/overview/> that it expected to hire just five external MDs across 2025. Tang's arrival means the bank is now 20% of the way towards last year's total.
